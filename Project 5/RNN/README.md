# Project 5
- Good new: All files were cleary tested, and trained models were provided.
- Bad new: Instead of replicating Neubig's code, we had to implement in our style as previous projects suggests.
  - We have applied minibatching in all models, therefore, there is no seperate file/code for minibatching.
  - Instead of proposing two seperate files, as Knet allows, we have combined both sentiment anlaysis codes (rnn and lstm versions) into one file.
    - Models of both implementations provided and can be obtained by just switching off **is_lstm_strategy_on** variable in the code.

- You can access the trained models via following Drive link:
