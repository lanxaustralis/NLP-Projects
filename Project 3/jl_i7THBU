i remember when i was a kid in the morning when i was a <unk> boy .
my father was in the morning , and he was the first little <unk> , he 's just tearing it up .
we have a <unk> , so we 're not there , because we 're not there , because we 're not going to be able to see it .
`` `` '' no , no , no , no , no , he 's got a <unk> ! '' ''
i could n't tell you what i did , but i was very happy , but i was very happy .
`` he said , `` '' this is a real school . ''
i never never had a <unk> .
it 's a real school .
i was the first time i was going to school school and i was ready to school , and i was in afghanistan .
so for the next five years , we 're not going to be able to be a <unk> , and that 's why the next five years is a <unk> .
and that 's the only way we had to do with the education .
we 've gone every day and we 're going to get a whole bunch of days to figure out what 's going on .
`` `` '' you 're not going to take your <unk> to your <unk> , just like a <unk> . '' ''
the world was born , a small home room , a small home room in the world .
it was cold , but it was cold .
we are all our children in our lives , our children , our children and our children .
and then time time , they were n't going to be a school , because they 're not going to be <unk> .
we 've always asked us about what we 're going to do .
who are you carrying ?
where are we living in the world ?
we are still born , but we 're still going to be there .
i was a <unk> kid , and i was teaching a <unk> of a <unk> family .
my grandfather was a very successful man .
one of the most successful <unk> of the family , the <unk> , the <unk> , and he was a <unk> , and he was telling her to her father , and he was telling her to her .
but my father was a homemaker .
there he is .
two years ago , the girls were raped and they were invited to meet the girls and girls to go to school .
and that was the first time — the first family in the family .
that was n't the way that the teachers were n't going to be able to learn from the school , even though they 're not going to be successful .
we 're trying to save them as a child .
i remember the time we 've been on the world , and sometimes if we 're hungry , they 're going to be <unk> and they 're going to be the only thing that we 're going to be .
`` i wanted to change the world , but my father said , `` '' i 'm going to be a <unk> . '' ''
we had to fight the <unk> . we had to fight the taliban .
but the only thing that you have to do is take you to go to the next place , and you 're going to be able to welcome the <unk> of the <unk> .
`` now , do n't you deserve afghanistan anymore ? '' '' and i 'm still on the street . ''
we 've been a <unk> epidemic in europe .
my parents would be more than five percent of my children in my school , and i was still going to be a <unk> , but i would be able to do that in the first time that i was going to be .
so , as i 'm standing in a <unk> , you 're a <unk> <unk> .
( applause ) when i was in afghanistan , the first time i was in afghanistan , the police of the taliban who were <unk> me , was the most vulnerable <unk> of their own .
i was the first woman in the first intifada , and i was the youngest woman in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the taliban .
( applause ) my parents believe me .
i have my own passion , but my family had a huge passion to make me feel more .
so it was a global campaign for global development for global development .
so the first school that we 're working with is not only the school , and it 's not just a school that 's been raped in school , and it 's not just a school for the school .
what was really interesting about the work of the arts was to create a lot of students in the classroom .
and i see my own friends , and i think that my father can be <unk> by the <unk> of my own lives .
it 's not like the <unk> , but it 's not the same story . he 's a <unk> man , and he 's a <unk> man .
a few months ago , they were going to take a <unk> and put the door on the floor , and they were going to be able to get a <unk> of their own <unk> .
when she got a door , i would have a friend of mine , and i would go back to the door , and i would have a friend of mine .
`` if you 're thinking about , `` '' i 'm going to tell you , '' '' but he says , `` '' i 'm going to be a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , but the moment that the <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> . ''
i 'm not saying that the key thing is not to be a problem .
they 're really proud of the first generation that they 're going to be in afghanistan and women , but they have a lot of women who are in the united states , for the first generation of women .
you remember the taliban who were not in the taliban 's office when they were in school , they were n't going to die .
but today , we have three million girls in the middle of the u.s .
( applause ) the united states looks like this in the united states .
i see the <unk> of the american <unk> .
these things are the <unk> of the <unk> of the war , when i was in afghanistan , i was afraid of <unk> .
but when i see the future , when i see the war , i see a lot of time , and i think that the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives is a long time .
for me , my life is the only way of being able to be the <unk> of the family and the women and the <unk> of the country .
they have great opportunities .
thank you .
( applause )
now you see the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
and it seems a little bit more complicated .
that 's the only way we 're living in the world 's lives .
we 're looking at the ocean , and the earth is now moving around the world , and the <unk> of the ocean is also very small .
but of course , life .
`` people are always looking for each other to each other , and the first person is `` '' the matrix '' '' ? '' '' and the question is , `` '' are you going to be ? ''
is it possible ? is it a potential for a different solution ?
when we 're trying to make these people who are <unk> them , we 're going to give them a little bit of their own .
`` `` '' what 's your <unk> ? '' ''
how do you get a lot ? what are you doing ?
then we could make more <unk> .
`` `` `` have you ever been seen ? '' ''
`` `` do you ever ever ever ? '' ''
`` `` are you going to win the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ? '' ''
`` `` what are you going to be ? '' '' `` `` hey , '' '' and they were <unk> . ''
`` `` what are you accused of ? '' ''
i know that .
we have to rely on people who are using people who are <unk> .
we want to see how we can see how we can see people who are in our own lives .
we have to be able to motivate the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
we 're seeing the <unk> of the lives of our lives .
`` sometimes , you know , `` '' what 's going on ? '' '' and he said , `` '' you know , you 're going to take a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> . '' '' and he would have a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> . ''
because i 've been on the side of the word .
the faces are very large .
and that might be a really dangerous situation .
i 'm not going to talk about this as a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
i grew up in a very small world .
in the early '90s , the first time , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> industry .
<unk> and <unk> are a social <unk> of social <unk> .
`` i 'm a writer or a <unk> artist , or `` '' <unk> '' '' or `` '' <unk> '' '' or `` '' <unk> '' '' — but it 's a <unk> of art , or a <unk> . ''
( laughter ) this is a new <unk> , but when you learn about a new age of information , you learn how to learn from the new yorker , but you learn how to read the city .
and i decided to do that , as i said , i wanted to be six .
i went to school , and we had to teach kids to be able to get the kids to do with the kids .
they told girls to be married .
`` so i went back to the night , and i said , `` '' i want to go home and go home . '' '' and i said , `` '' hey , i 'm going to go , '' '' and she said , `` '' hey , what 's going on ? ''
you can imagine that i could do that again .
i did n't want to know who i was , and i did n't want to .
this is eight years old .
that was me , when i was seven years old .
`` one of the organizers of the book is `` '' <unk> <unk> '' '' — he 's a <unk> <unk> , and he 's just <unk> with the <unk> , and he 's got a <unk> . ''
so , that 's a <unk> , and i 'm not a pediatrician , and i was at the end of the <unk> , because i was a <unk> kid , and that was the reason why i was five , and that was a mistake .
in fact , i was n't alone to tell me what i was doing , what i did n't know — what i did n't know about my parents , what i was doing .
they were often refusing to be <unk> and they were told to be able to take their <unk> and their <unk> to take their <unk> and their <unk> to see what they were doing .
when i was in the water , i would be able to grab my hair as i was eating the water .
when i was friends , i would be able to tell me that i would be able to tell you that i would be able to help me to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
but i also have to be able to do that , or <unk> , or <unk> .
i was n't really sure i was a workaholic .
i felt like i was playing in a <unk> .
we have to be a <unk> .
but my parents , in my own family , they would like to be a <unk> , they would be able to get a sense of <unk> and <unk> their own <unk> .
but i was a sophomore , and i decided to go to school , and i decided to go to a <unk> .
i was a girl , and i was n't really sure what was going on and i was n't supposed to be what was going on .
it does n't seem to be a man 's truth to do it , right ?
and nobody 's not really sure .
( laughter ) but my parents would n't want me to do that .
when i was five years old , i was told that i was the first time when i was a girl , the girl who was telling us what was going on when i was a girl , and what was the most important thing that i was doing .
three years later , i was a <unk> kid , and i was n't even afraid of the <unk> of the <unk> .
look , i was a <unk> , and i was always a <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
every single one of them , i had to be <unk> , and i was always invited .
five years later , five million years ago , the great <unk> of this country is the <unk> of the 21st century .
and then i was n't really surprised that i was really afraid of doing .
but as a country , the european union has been a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> of a whole <unk> situation .
and i remember the question of the question and the question of the question , and the fact that i think the world is really <unk> , and the fact that the world is really <unk> , and the fact that the country is going to be <unk> by the fact that the <unk> is not really <unk> .
and then , of course , this was the <unk> of the <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> .
and that 's one of the four <unk> of the two <unk> , and i was n't in the <unk> of the four , because i was n't in the moment of the <unk> .
and then , at the end of my mother , i was a young woman who was <unk> by the girl , and the girl 's <unk> is a woman who 's been raped by the mother , and the girl 's <unk> , who is a young woman , and she was a young woman , and she was a young woman , and she was a young woman , and she was <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and the young woman , who was <unk> , and she was <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> .
`` so i 'm like a young girl , a young girl , a young girl who 's young women who are watching the women of the young women who are young than the young women , and the `` '' <unk> '' '' — but the young woman , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> . ''
i love this , but i 've been watching the people , but we 've seen the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
and it was a very powerful <unk> , a <unk> , and i was a <unk> , and i was a <unk> of <unk> .
we were a <unk> , and you 're a <unk> .
i 'm not a leader .
i 'm living in my life .
but that was the question that i realized that i was wondering , who would have been asked to know that the people who are not going to have a question , and how do you make a difference in the world ?
how do we get to the other group of people who are not allowed to have a choice ?
what about a group of a group ? what is the group ?
and would these people have a kind of <unk> <unk> ?
they wondered who they were , and who wondered who they were ?
and then i thought that the second thing that i could do is they can make a <unk> <unk> , and if they do n't get people to do it , they 're going to be able to do it .
we were able to give them them .
i 've been there with a million people who had no <unk> or <unk> or not , but i could n't have a <unk> , or a single <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
because the image of the photo is a <unk> <unk> , because you can see that it 's a <unk> .
for me , it 's not about the last poem , but it 's not about the <unk> of the people who are not talking about the fact that the story is not just about the <unk> , but the other thing is , it 's a lot of people who are not there .
the books that show people are the <unk> of the people who were familiar by the <unk> of the <unk> .
so i decided to do a very simple task , which is a <unk> portrait of the <unk> .
and i mean , if i do n't want to know that there are no <unk> in the world , there are no three people , no , that 's not a <unk> .
( laughter ) so , we needed a huge job , and we needed to do it .
so i went to the <unk> , and i was in the middle of two years , and i 've been in the northern hemisphere of the year of the year .
and i went to the website and i went to the store , and i wanted to help them .
and they even spent the two weeks of new york .
and then we did it .
( music ) joseph : i 'm just a <unk> student , a <unk> student , a technologist in new york . ( laughter )
the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
the first thing is , i 'm going to tell you about 30 percent of the <unk> , or you 're not going to be able to make a difference for everyone who 's got a <unk> .
the point is , i 'm going to show you a whole bit of a <unk> of all of us .
`` ( music ) we 're all saying that these people are all losers . '' ''
this is from the <unk> of the indus ii .
we 're not as good as we 're not talking about the <unk> of the security of the economy .
there 's no united states in the united states .
`` [ `` '' what 's your free leader ? '' '' ( applause ) `` '' what 's your voice ? '' '' ( applause ) `` '' <unk> <unk> . '' '' ( laughter ) and it 's like the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , to be honest . ''
it 's not just about the quality of health care workers .
today , in the u.s. , the country is not just the country , because it 's more than the population of the country .
`` [ `` '' who are the people ? '' '' and i said , `` '' well , there are other people who are all there , and we 've got all of us . ''
we 've been in new york than the new york times .
and we could not have the ability to do the <unk> of our society without destroying the human rights .
i want to put this project in the united states .
i want to talk to you about the next five or a half people in the united states or <unk> .
this is the <unk> of my rights rights rights .
i invite you to see that people are going to be a better person than they 're all in the other side of a different situation .
`` ( music ) ( music ) '' '' `` '' <unk> '' '' ] [ `` '' <unk> '' '' ] ( '' <unk> '' '' ] ( '' <unk> '' '' ] ( applause ) '' '' but we 're not going to hear everything . ''
they 've seen a thousand people who were going to take the data , and they 're going to take us to the south , and they 've seen the people who are going to take us to the south of the world .
and he wanted to say that many people would have been more interested .
i 've been in the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is from the world 's <unk> , and i was almost 30 years ago , and i 've been seen to be nearly 20 or 30 years ago .
i know that i 'm going to talk about a minute , but i do n't want to talk about a friend of mine , because i do n't have a few minutes of time , but i do n't have a conversation .
because there 's a picture of a new picture of a new picture that shows a new symmetry that 's going to happen in a new way .
so , we looked at the <unk> and the south of the south , and the first thing that happened in the south , was the first time in the 20th century .
really really <unk> .
`` the <unk> is actually `` '' <unk> '' '' is a <unk> <unk> . ''
you 're not as much as a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> .
of course , i met the women who were living in the <unk> of the poor , but i was also afraid of the people who were not afraid of the <unk> of the poor people who were not afraid of the <unk> .
we had to be <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
but what i 'm really interested about is that we 're really interested in the things that are happening in the world , the <unk> of the world .
in fact , it 's the case , to them .
not only that , but it 's a different kind of <unk> that 's different , but it 's the same kind of recursive experience .
`` it 's not `` '' <unk> '' '' is not very much , it 's very , very much . ''
`` and i realized that i had a different word `` '' <unk> '' '' because there was a different difference between the <unk> , because there were thousands of different things that were different . ''
i 've been doing it for the other person , and i 'd been doing the other thing that i could do for my life , and i was doing it for the rest of the day .
in one point , i 've been asked to know about a number of people who are <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and they 've got a number of people who are on the table .
and i realized that the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> was so much better than that .
( laughter ) people did n't know what they 're supposed to do , because they did n't want to know them .
can you get a <unk> ?
but after the result , when people were treated , they were about three percent of the <unk> and the <unk> and the americans .
of course , there are a lot of people in the united states , but i 've been able to do that , but it 's a little bit more than a dozen people who have been treated with the fact that they 're not going to be a little bit of a lot of time .
`` i 've seen that people are very interested in the <unk> , the `` '' <unk> '' '' — `` '' i 'm not going to talk to you . '' '' i do n't know what the word is , `` '' you 're not familiar with the <unk> . '' ''
and i 'm not going to be able to be a <unk> <unk> , because i think that if you 're a <unk> , you will be able to have the <unk> of the <unk> , and you will be able to find that you have to be able to live .
i just just go to the <unk> for the <unk> .
( laughter ) when i said , what 's not just is the human mind .
the most important thing that we want to do is to have a number of people who are in the world , and there are two people who are in the world , and there are people who are not there , and there 's a number of people who are <unk> the same way , and we 're going to have a <unk> of what 's going on .
and the reality of this is that it 's a reality of reality .
because , in a nutshell , where you could not be able to see if they 're not allowed to be able to have a <unk> , where is the <unk> of the <unk> ?
is it that there 's a relationship between the two or two who are there ?
or are it a place where you have two or two or two people in the audience ?
how many of you are the person who are in the middle of the world ?
the other thing i learned about is that the <unk> of the <unk> is a <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> is really <unk> .
and to tell you that this is a very , very , very , very scary and implausible , and i think that every time you have the privilege of being able to do this is the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the human and the <unk> , and the people who have the privilege to do it .
we have to have a <unk> relationship in the history of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the outcome of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of all of us .
so , i think that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , you can even read the <unk> , you can even read your <unk> , or maybe you can imagine that it 's more than a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and it 's a very important story .
and i hope these are these things , these are <unk> , and they 're going to be able to adapt these products .
because nothing , we do n't realize anything that we can do , and we 're not there to do anything that we could n't see .
we see , the people who are in the <unk> are the <unk> .
and it 's more , more than the <unk> of the <unk> .
at the first time , i think it 's more likely to improve the human rights .
so , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , is the classic person , the <unk> , the <unk> , who is the <unk> of the <unk> , and why is it that you 're going to be there ?
whether you 're young or young or young or young , or you 're older , you 're not going to be a girl or a girl , or you 're not going to be a girl or a girl , you 're not going to be <unk> by your mother , you 're not going to be <unk> , you know , you 're going to be <unk> , you know ?
very late .
because i 'm not going to be able to do that .
we are <unk> , and we 're always always going to be <unk> .
so , please , like us , we 're all human beings , and we 're not likable , we 're rational .
thank you .
( applause )
the <unk> rouge peaked in the northeast monsoon .
it 's very difficult to breathe , and it 's very warm to breathe .
i can see the red person in the heart of my life , but i can see that i 'm not going to be more afraid to see .
i hear people with friends , but they 're familiar with the sounds of the <unk> , and the sound of the audience 's voice is very much more <unk> .
and i was very , very different , as i was in the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> was made to the <unk> , and the <unk> was made to the <unk> , and the <unk> was made to the <unk> , and the <unk> was made to the <unk> .
and i looked at the couch , and i remember that i had a friend of mine who died in the back of the day .
when i talk to you today , people are going to die in the poor , but they 're not going to be <unk> by the poor , or the majority of the people who are poor .
they can go back to the ceremony and they would n't be able to go to the street , but they never do n't have the privilege of being stuck .
for the last six years , i 've been working in the united states and the <unk> foundation , and i 've been working in the united states of the world , and the reason that i was facing the global peace industry .
i found that there was a wonderful tradition of <unk> that was being created by the <unk> of the human society , to the <unk> of the human society .
we started talking about the world and i started talking about the world , and i think that the world is n't entirely , but it 's not entirely true .
i was there to be a little girl , and i was there to be a little bit of a lot of people in my life , and i thought , well , i 'm not going to be doing this for the first time , and i said , what did i do ?
it started about this <unk> , and i started to be working in the <unk> , and i went to the <unk> , and he went to the <unk> of the <unk> .
so my journey started to come from today .
the <unk> is , in fact , the ones that are in this room .
and some of them were even like my home .
but this time , the <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of today is a worldwide worldwide worldwide .
this is the only two <unk> of the world in the middle of the world .
it was 150 years ago , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a year of <unk> .
it costs about 50 dollars today .
but the only family now is going to be able to get to the hospital for 18 minutes .
it 's estimated that the world 's population is about 86 billion dollars per capita .
most good education , the best way to do good , <unk> , <unk> , and they have to be able to be able to get a good job , a good way of being <unk> .
today , today , the u.s. sector has not been used to be used to be able to attract the <unk> , but it 's not going to be <unk> .
there are places in the world , in the world , in the world .
the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i can be able to see the same kind of <unk> , or ancient <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> .
in the 1950s , in the middle , the women in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
and in the hospital , the same thing , and they 've done it in the same way , and they 're trying to make it better for the same time .
we had water , and we had no water , and we had a lot of water that was n't contaminated .
the water was thicker , and the air was very cold , and the air was made to the <unk> .
i was a little girl , and i started to go to the <unk> , and i thought that if you were to get the <unk> , the more people who were <unk> , and they were able to make it better , and they were able to make it better for the <unk> .
`` i 'd go back to the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> of the `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' and the <unk> of the people , and the people who have n't been there , and i 'm going to be a <unk> , and it 's a bit of a <unk> . ''
i would n't be able to help them .
they do n't have to pay anything or anything .
i was not a leader of this country .
you can see them with a better way to see them and they 're not going to see them .
i had to be able to control the system to control the freedom of freedom , and i could n't have to be able to do that .
for me , when i was a teenager , i got my <unk> .
i saw the dead , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the trees were now below the <unk> of the mountain floor .
the children are <unk> them , and they were able to make them easier , and they 're <unk> them with their children , their families , their <unk> and their families , and their families .
it 's hard to see what it is .
how do we do something that we can do with something that 's a very abstract thing ?
they 're not allowed to be <unk> by the <unk> , because they 've been raped for all of those who have been raped , because they were all there .
they do n't even know that they 're living in a world .
and when the police were jewish , they were all part of their parents , their <unk> .
so , they did n't have to be doing this thing , but they did n't want to be able to make it happen , but they wanted to make it happen , because they were doing a <unk> , but they were doing it for the people who were doing it for the <unk> , and they were able to make it work , and they were able to make it to the <unk> , and they 're doing it for the help of the <unk> .
`` we think we 're looking at the <unk> of the <unk> , and the people who are trying to think about the `` '' the 99 '' '' and `` '' the health of the world '' '' — and that 's because the health is not really good to be in the public . ''
women who were <unk> me with me to be <unk> me .
the <unk> that was <unk> is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i 'm a <unk> <unk> .
it looked like a <unk> .
they 're in the streets of the caribbean , and they 're fighting to eat their food .
there are fewer groups , and there are fewer kids , one of them , and they 're kids , and they 're less likely to be healthy , and they 're less likely to be healthy and healthier , and they 're going to be able to be healthy .
there 's a dark signal , and the <unk> is the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> .
the men who are relieved are told that they 're not sexually ill .
i almost looked at it as a <unk> , and i was feeling like you 're sitting in the morning , and i was feeling so that you could n't imagine that it was completely <unk> .
there was one <unk> : i had a <unk> .
there was no <unk> .
there were no <unk> structures .
we have no idea of people , not only about the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
hundreds of people have been torn up , and there are a lot of people who are <unk> .
in the last year , the average american <unk> of the united states , almost tripled , and almost every year , almost seven people have been given to the average american .
that 's everywhere . we 're all there .
another thing that we think of <unk> is that we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i 've been in a <unk> fellowship in the united states in the united states .
this is a family of family .
they 're white holes in red , white and white , blue and blue .
and it was like this big <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they 're <unk> , but they 're <unk> , but they 're <unk> .
he told me that he was going to tell me about his story .
we 're not saying we 're not .
`` `` '' if we 're going to be a little bit , we 're going to have a <unk> , and we 're going to have a <unk> <unk> , and it 's a little bit more likely to think about the world 's population , which is a very good day for the world 's future . ''
when we first went to the first time , we got a little bit of a <unk> .
i grew up in a small village in a small neighborhood , a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of , like , a little bit of <unk> , right ?
they were wrong . they 're all wrong .
the kids are not allowed to work in the <unk> , and they 're not going to spend the <unk> , and they 're not going to be able to do it , and they 're not going to be able to do it .
this is eight years old .
when she was sitting in the room , there were little <unk> that she had n't had her little sticker .
i was surrounded by the water of the water .
and the <unk> of the tree of the tree of the tree is the tree of water , and the <unk> is very <unk> , and they 're not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to make a <unk> .
most of them are <unk> .
it took place , until we 've been there , that we could n't afford to be able to recover this land .
it 's not as happy as the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , and she 's going to be able to make the <unk> of the <unk> .
i 've met this day in the morning of <unk> day , and i 've been in the morning , but the day is the day .
they were in the air .
and i think you have to have these <unk> , more than the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
i want you to introduce you to the <unk> .
farmers have a <unk> in bangladesh .
i met a <unk> that was suffering in the way that he was suffering in a democratic society .
and what it 's like here , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the food , the food , and the good guys , the kids , and the kids who have the best , the families , the families , the families , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the families , the families , the families , the families .
this is from <unk> <unk> .
how can it affect the impact of the lives of the lives of the lives of life ?
when i was in the united states , the <unk> of the united states was a <unk> , and he was being attacked by a <unk> <unk> .
he told us that the river is going to feed the forest that she 's going to take us to the forest .
he said he 'd kissed his head , and he 'd come back to the <unk> .
`` and then the little bit of them , he said , `` '' well , it 's like the <unk> . '' '' and he started to see the <unk> , and he was there , and he was there , and he was there , and he was there , and he was there , and he was <unk> , and he was <unk> , and he was <unk> , and he was <unk> , and he was <unk> , he was <unk> . ''
and after a few months , he had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> of the <unk> , and he was completely <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> .
the old <unk> and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the water .
it 's used to be used by the <unk> .
this photo comes from a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> islands .
when we were able to get the <unk> of the <unk> , we could n't forget that day .
i remember the time i had died , when i was in the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
some <unk> <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> is the <unk> , and they 're doing it for the <unk> .
the first thing is that we 're seeing a lot of people who are not really smart , but we 're not going to see the <unk> , but the young people are going to be able to see them .
they all deserved , and it 's a disease and a disease .
in fact , this is really going to be the only <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
that was her father , her father , her father , he was raped by her husband .
when he died , he was <unk> him as a <unk> <unk> in her <unk> .
and they looked at the <unk> , and it was like this was the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> was the first time , and it was like the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and then , in the middle of the day , there are still hundreds of kids who are still there , but they 're all <unk> .
and yet , in my home , the government of the local government , and the idea of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , and the idea of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wanted to make a little bit of energy .
and as i was doing this project , i made my own <unk> and i wanted to show them to my colleagues and i 'd let them read the photos of the people that i would have been able to do with my own <unk> and their colleagues .
they knew that people would have seen the world in the world .
i would like to see them , we can do them with them , and we can do them with their lives .
i think we 're really , really , like if we 're in the world , it 's really hard to be a human being , that we 're not going to be a good way of thinking about it .
these people are not the same thing that i 'm not sure , but people are not sure that people and they 're not going to be a <unk> , and they 're the same person .
it 's really good to say that i 'm not going to be the worst person in the worst times , and i 'm not going to be the worst of the people i 've ever heard of .
i hope that if you look at these pictures of light , you will see that the human body is going to be a <unk> , and if you 're a <unk> , it 's a natural , because it 's a <unk> of light , but it 's going to be a <unk> of light , because it 's going to be a light of light .
thank you very much .
`` ( applause ) and when we go to the end of the war , `` '' we 're going to be <unk> . '' '' ( laughter ) ''
in the 19th century , the <unk> of the east coast of the <unk> is the <unk> .
but in fact , the new world and the <unk> of the new and the <unk> of the city .
it 's also a new way of developing the city , the international economy , the international economy , the international regional system .
so you can see the complexity here . it 's the <unk> of the world .
these are <unk> factories in the <unk> of 40 percent .
the ancient design of my career and my colleagues , my new career , a new <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , is a <unk> of the <unk> .
and at this point , i started working with this company , and i started working with the public and the public and the people who work in the public .
and it took a two-year annual journey for the last 50 years .
and after a while , we 've got a <unk> <unk> , and we 're not going to have a <unk> <unk> , but we 're not going to have to be able to make the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , because it 's a <unk> <unk> .
and i thought that there 's a lot of modern science in the modern world , which is the modern , <unk> , <unk> .
so , in my own <unk> , i 've been able to build a new <unk> , or a <unk> , or <unk> , to the new , <unk> environment that can be used to build new <unk> .
so , as you can see , we started to build a project that was designed to build a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and it 's been a wonderful project , and it 's been a wonderful project , and it 's a wonderful way of doing this , and it 's a very different way of doing this .
this is a group of <unk> , one of our children .
they 're always going to be <unk> every week .
they all have a <unk> .
they were coming back to the local revolution .
it 's a <unk> program .
this is the kind of <unk> i 've ever seen .
and it 's still happening in the world , but there are two <unk> in the world .
and the rest is that you should not have to be able to do that .
thank you very much .
( applause )
i 'm here to say that the important question of the climate crisis is the important question of why the answer is important for the people , why is it important ?
if you 're not , what you 're going to do .
so , here 's the thing . we did n't have a good project to do the project that was <unk> in the last year .
this is my <unk> .
it 's like a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
now , you know , you know , the <unk> of the day is the day .
so you 're on the left , you 're just trying to see the <unk> , and you 're just the <unk> of the <unk> .
you 're in your <unk> , your <unk> , your <unk> , and you 're going to be able to understand that .
now , i know you 're going to have a <unk> , but i 'm going to tell you that it 's a <unk> of the <unk> .
so , the logic of my own consciousness , is completely profound .
but this is the ipad .
this is a <unk> of every single <unk> cell in a single cell .
each of them have a different <unk> of <unk> .
the first morning , the sun is the first organ of light , the <unk> of the sun , the <unk> , the <unk> , the light of the body .
the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> force .
so for the next day , the <unk> of the body is different .
it 's only one of the oldest ones that can tell us that the old day .
you know why my <unk> hated me .
what i 'm sure of you is that i do n't want to hate it .
the problem for me is that it 's been a surprise for me to do that .
`` so , why is the good question , `` '' why do n't we get better ? '' ''
when i saw the women i 've been working with a woman , a lot of women who were engaged in a young way , i found a lot of <unk> , or a <unk> .
and when he was doing this , i was writing the importance of the puzzle .
so i decided to do different different things about my life in my life .
so i made this thing to do what i call the robot 's <unk> .
in the vertical axis , we have a <unk> version of the <unk> , and it 's about 10 centimeters per second , and then you have the <unk> .
as i 've been doing a <unk> , it 's almost about the <unk> of the <unk> , and it 's about the <unk> of the <unk> .
so let me show you how quickly i 'm going to show you a quick video .
ng : this is not a company . ( laughter ) this is a private <unk> <unk> .
( <unk> noises ) ( <unk> <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( video ) ( video ) and how it 's like you 've been fooled by the <unk> of the year , and what 's called the <unk> of the <unk> .
here 's some other results .
the first is to go to the <unk> .
now , the sound is very loud , but the sound is still loud , but the sound is <unk> .
you know . i do n't want to be there . i do n't want to pay it .
well , the next one is <unk> .
i still get to the people in the audience .
okay , and bed .
the reason that i think is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the one thing i thought was , and the reason i was paid to be , and the reason that i was paid , and the money is so expensive , and it 's a lot of money , and it 's a good thing to do , and it 's so good to say that it 's a good thing to do .
okay . so , what 's the best way of watching the <unk> of the five ?
and that , of course , is the <unk> of the top line .
now , you can not say that it 's not as much as you can read your experience as a <unk> .
it 's just just the last few years that i 've been hearing about the last few years .
now , sex is sex . sex sex .
the great thing is that the five people are the same <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
so it helps us to be a good girl who 's good to be able to do with five things .
now , when i was five years old , i looked at the solar system , the same <unk> movement of the sun .
and i realized that the reason that the <unk> was n't really good at the time why the <unk> was better .
see , it 's just the tip of the visual cortex , and it 's a little bit of consistency .
here 's the robot here .
it 's the first time that we have the power of the <unk> .
in fact , the five <unk> of five years is a <unk> .
that 's why i learned that this is the theory of the theory .
and , as you see , we 're all experts , and we 're all trying to do that , and we 're all a <unk> , and we 're all a <unk> of the <unk> .
it 's called the <unk> of the <unk> , and it 's just one example that you can use a single <unk> of a human being .
so what if we took five of our time to create our own <unk> ?
so i 'll give you three quick numbers .
`` we 're going to put it out . '' '' okay . ''
i think if you 're not going to eat the <unk> , and if you 're not going to eat , you 'd be <unk> , if you 're not going to eat , you 're not going to eat it , and you 're not going to eat it , you know , you 're <unk> .
there 's a <unk> of something that is <unk> , and it 's got a <unk> .
i just love not just to love the feelings of the soul .
i was going to have a robot , or i decided to make a <unk> , and i want to put a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
now , when we look at this idea , we see that the five dimensions of the brain , the way we see it , we 're using the same thing that 's going on the way that we can see the data .
now , i think that the only thing that 's not about the most extraordinary thing is not about the world .
there are four things that are going to be the <unk> of the <unk> .
maybe that 's the future of my future .
so , by the way , please have to go back to your own <unk> , and you can see that your own <unk> is going to be able to move it up .
oh , no , before something .
the best way to do that is to pay the car .
are you ready ?
all right .
( applause )
when i was seven , i was a <unk> .
the story of our own experience is to make sense of each other , but also to give us a sense of what we wanted to do .
so it all came out of all of us and all the time and all the people in the room .
`` go to the <unk> , and go back and go . '' '' and he said , `` '' wow , how cool is it ? '' ''
what could happen ?
( laughter ) we 've heard the first time we 've been there , and we were all like the <unk> of the <unk> .
then 20 people , 20 people , 20 , 20 , five .
and three people .
i was one of them .
( applause ) <unk> .
at that moment , i was n't .
the internet center center .
`` does n't we have a good word to say , `` '' no . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' why ? '' '' and what if we could do this , why not people ? ''
`` you 're going to hear the next 10 minutes . '' '' ( laughter ) and you 've got to say , `` '' you know , you know , `` '' you know , you 're not really good at this . ''
but i do n't know who 's going to die with the day .
was i a teacher ?
and he had to have a three three <unk> of three <unk> to be able to be a <unk> .
it 's a funny thing .
it 's a lot of people who are watching the <unk> of the <unk> .
there was nothing wrong with this day .
that 's me , and that 's a better , and that 's a better thing than they could ever be a better .
that 's it .
let 's take eight years .
bill gates was in the world — he 's in the middle of the leader , and he was there , and he said , `` '' well , you know , you know , i 'm going to see it .
i love this guy .
oh , i know what i want to do .
and i wrote it in this , and i wrote it in a book .
here — ( laughter ) — ( laughter ) — you know , there 's no <unk> — you know , it 's a <unk> <unk> , but it 's not a <unk> .
you 'll start the idea .
( laughter ) so ...
this is another : another world , the world 's future .
two years later , i had to be a <unk> of the united states .
i went to the right place , because it 's the right place , right ?
( laughter ) i thought that the idea of the economy is the beginning of the <unk> .
then , let me go back to 14 years .
i was 30 .
no , he 's a company .
even even even even even more .
in fact , it was 700 million dollars in silicon valley .
i felt <unk> . i was <unk> .
why ?
who 's a boy who 's pregnant at the time ?
it 's not because of the <unk> .
one thing he wants to do — he 's got a world — he 's going to do a world .
and he has always won it .
this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i 've been working in the financial business conference , who had to be there for the next time , and i 'm ready to be there ?
a journalist , i found a lot of money , but i think i can .
and i would n't forget that <unk> me .
i was so happy that i wanted to go back to the moment .
but then i thought , well , would n't it be a great , <unk> <unk> attack ?
is it a great amount of money ?
never .
and there 's the things that happened .
okay , good company .
i can make a better job , but i can do a better job , but it 's a better thing to do .
i have to be a better person .
i could n't do my own son to do my own experiment .
i had to go into the place where it was .
so , i started to look at the internet .
google is my google .
`` ( laughter ) `` '' i 've seen your fear of fear . '' '' and i think , `` '' what 's wrong with fear of fear and anxiety , and how much of the people who have n't seen it ? ''
`` and then i was on the `` '' <unk> '' '' — `` '' how many of you know that the <unk> of the <unk> is `` '' <unk> '' '' ? ''
( laughter ) but why would i be so afraid of myself ?
so i found this very carefully .
it 's called <unk> .
`` ( laughter ) `` '' <unk> '' '' is a company called <unk> <unk> . ''
his name is <unk> <unk> .
and basically , the thing is , you 're going to take a <unk> , and you 're going to take a <unk> and you get the <unk> , and you 're going to get the kids in the day , and then you get the kids .
i love this idea .
`` ( laughter ) i said , `` '' what ? '' '' i do . ''
`` and i did n't think about `` '' <unk> . '' '' and i always wrote it every day , and i wrote it every day , and i wrote a book . ''
that 's what i did .
that 's what the <unk> looked like .
one day later .
( laughter ) let 's take a dollar of a dollar .
i went to the place where i was there .
i looked at the security security .
i got him in her .
i was born in my body , and my grandmother was <unk> , and i was feeling in my hair , and my hair , and my <unk> .
`` i went to the question , and i said , `` i 'll ask you to be <unk> . '' ''
`` ( laughter ) you can see me , `` '' no . '' '' no . ''
`` i said , `` '' oh ! oh , i got my head . '' '' and i went back . ''
( laughter ) it 's very <unk> .
because i saw myself — i saw my grandmother 's eyes , and i saw how much i saw .
`` i see `` '' i see the man . '' '' i looked like the normal man . ''
( laughter ) but i saw this guy .
it 's scary enough .
`` he was a little bit , and he said , `` '' why did he feel like he was going to be a terrorist ? '' '' he said , `` '' i was going to return to the <unk> . ''
i could n't tell you something .
<unk> , <unk> .
i did n't have any other .
i had the same one .
i felt like that in my life , a kind of <unk> .
i could n't be able to be able to get the same amount of time as quickly as i could .
you know what ?
the next day , what you 're going to do is , or whatever .
i 'm not feeling to be alive .
`` the second day : `` '' i 'm going to go to the loo . '' '' ( laughter ) and i said , `` '' i 'm going to go to the <unk> , and you 're going to go to the <unk> , and you 're going to go to the <unk> . '' '' and i said , `` '' okay , you 're going to go to the store . ''
`` and the author says , `` '' oh , i 'm not going to be a <unk> . '' '' ( laughter ) and he said , `` '' i 'm going to be a <unk> . '' '' ( laughter ) and we said , `` '' what 's wrong with you . '' '' ( laughter ) but we said , `` '' but there 's no way you 're going to be . ''
`` i like to say , `` '' i love the <unk> , and i love the <unk> , and i love the <unk> . '' '' ( laughter ) and i said , `` '' i love you . '' '' ( laughter ) but i wanted to say , `` '' i love you . '' '' but i thought , `` '' i love you . '' ''
and by the way , i do n't think they 're going to have the same answer .
( laughter ) i think i still am still .
but the first time i had n't been in the heart of the body , because i was n't feeling , because i was feeling remorse , i was exhausted .
`` i said , `` '' oh , i love this wonderful thing . ''
`` great . '' '' and then i went to the big york . ''
here 's my life in my life .
i went to the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not a place in the south africa in southern africa .
i 'm here here .
`` i said , `` '' can you be able to make the <unk> <unk> ? ''
`` i said , `` '' five <unk> . '' '' okay ? '' '' i said , `` '' okay , i do n't know . ''
he was really disturbed by the authorities to do it .
`` ( laughter ) `` '' the graduate of the book , '' '' and he looked at the couch and looked at the <unk> , and he looked at the floor , and he looked at the chair , and he looked at the chair . ''
they 're very much .
i can be .
and this video video video has been much more than two million .
we do n't believe the world .
( laughter ) so i went to the audience , talking about the news .
and i became famous .
`` a lot of people started asking me , `` '' i have to tell you . '' '' and he was doing it , and it was a <unk> , and it was n't really good . ''
what i 'd like to do is to tell you , and i want to learn everything .
i was going to spend half the entire world 's <unk> to the day — and i wanted to do this thing .
i wanted to see what was going on .
and i learned a lot .
i found a lot of mistakes .
`` for example , i said , `` '' i 'm a <unk> , '' '' and i said , `` '' oh , you know , `` '' why is the <unk> ? '' '' and i said , `` '' why do you take a <unk> ? '' '' and i said , `` '' hey , i 'm going to take a look at the <unk> , and i put it in the house , and i said , `` '' hey , i 'm going to go out of the car . ''
`` ( laughter ) `` '' no , no . '' '' and he said , `` '' no , how do i do that ? ''
`` and there 's `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' i have to have a <unk> . '' '' and i think it 's always the <unk> . ''
i do n't want to eat the <unk> .
i was very surprised by the beginning .
( laughter ) after one day , i was eating a <unk> <unk> .
i 'm sure that 's pretty good .
( laughter ) but then i was the first time i did n't get the first job , because i could n't make sure that i could n't make sure that they were , because they were good , but they were good .
he was n't sure he was n't going to be able to do it .
and he used me to make me a <unk> , a <unk> company .
i 've been doing this for the world .
`` so , for instance , i went to the <unk> and i said , `` '' you know , `` '' you know , `` '' what 's the <unk> ? '' '' and you know , `` '' hey , what if you do n't have a <unk> <unk> ? '' ''
you know , people who are familiar with this is that you 're going to be able to do something that 's going to be easy to do this .
`` i want to think about the `` '' <unk> , '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' i do n't have the idea of the good thing . '' '' and i do n't know if i was a good idea . ''
`` the man was norman <unk> . '' '' he said , `` '' oh , i 'm so sorry . '' '' he said , `` '' oh , i 'm so sorry . '' '' and he said , `` '' oh , i 'm a <unk> . '' '' and he said , `` '' oh , you know , it 's a little bit of this . '' '' and he said , `` '' i 'm a scientist . ''
he was like all of the gods in the room .
`` he said , `` '' yeah , you can do it . '' '' ( laughter ) and i said , `` '' i 'm going to do it for 30 hours . '' ''
`` i always told them , `` '' i 'm going to be a <unk> . '' '' and i always wanted to give you a hug . ''
by the way , i do n't know what to do , but i do n't know if you 're a <unk> .
( laughter ) it was really awful .
`` but i looked at this because i looked at this , `` '' i thought , `` '' well , i thought , `` '' okay , i 've been trying to make a difference in the room . ''
`` i said , `` '' do n't really matter that ? '' '' i thought , `` '' i 'm not really sure . ''
and i think that 's something that looks like this , actually , is a little bit of a painting .
again , i learned that i 'm not talking about the importance of the people that you know , the people who do n't know what the answer is .
and i learned that i could n't ask my life .
<unk> .
`` i grew up in a city of mine and a friend of mine and i said , `` '' if you 're a kid , you 're going to be a <unk> , but you 're not going to be a <unk> , but you 're not going to be a <unk> , but you 're not going to be a <unk> .
but something always happened to me .
but i was fortunate to work with the third and my father , who was a professor in the university of the <unk> .
`` he said , `` '' no , i 've got to do it . '' '' he had to do a <unk> <unk> . ''
`` dp : i can use it . '' ''
`` two months later , i wrote two months . '' '' and i went back to the end of the week , and i wrote two months . ''
that 's — i think — this is a normal picture .
sometimes you can see the light , right ?
( laughter ) but what i did — i started to see the <unk> , because i started to learn how to read , because i was in my life .
i thought , i had to be a great job , i had to be a big , or , really , i thought , i have to be a <unk> , but i did n't have the opportunity to go , and i did n't know .
this is a picture of the lady , the chairman of the king , dr. <unk> <unk> .
why ? because we 've got the opportunity to understand the world , and the people that are really interested in the world , and the people who are really excited about the world , and the people who are actually there .
martin luther king , jr. , jr. , jr. , or american luther rights , or the american rights .
these people are <unk> <unk> .
and then they want to learn from their own <unk> .
and they were <unk> .
we do n't have to be on the verge of people , and i 'm not going to be my own , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and he was all that disturbed me because i was all my own experience .
then i started to <unk> him .
i put this into my greatest life .
i started to learn how to live with people .
i used to use my company , i could use my career , i think , i used to use my <unk> .
you live in a dark time , you 're not sure you 're in the right way or you 're not going to be able to live .
<unk> .
if you 're going to be able to get them , you can be able to be able to be able to see it
thank you .
( applause )
`` <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . '' '' and the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> . ''
i grew up in a village in the village .
she was n't going to be a girl , and she was going to be a doctor , and she was going to be able to do it .
i think i 'm the most <unk> .
my mother had fallen 18 pounds .
in the age of seven , i could n't survive .
you can imagine what a child is like .
i 've seen women in the room , or the women in the room , or the women who are not there .
so i wanted to go to school , i was very young .
i wanted to help young people to help young women .
so i went back to the university of the university and i decided to go back to college .
no , i had no idea for the poor of the poor , because i had a scholarship for the families , but i was there .
so , my father , in my father , was sent to the united states .
i came from america .
i 'm <unk> in the studio .
i was in the u.s. in france , in france .
and you know what i did , i did n't know what happened in the school , and i was in the middle of the city .
it took months for him , and it was published .
my family was a refugee .
so i went to my family , and i went to my family in my family .
i wanted to be healthy .
how were i going to be my aunt ?
my <unk> was a <unk> .
when i was in the 1960s , i was always amazed with all of my children every day i 'd been on .
i wanted to go back to the place where i wanted to go to the ocean , but i did n't really have the place where i was there .
i had a good job .
i have a college professor .
we paid money .
i had a good life .
my family was <unk> .
i was able to do them with them .
but i was happy .
i wanted to go back home .
so i went to the refugee refugee .
when i went to afghanistan , where i met , there were 8,000 refugees in afghanistan , where refugee million refugees .
and then the women were about 40 percent of the men , and the men were n't there , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> .
when i spent a dozen days , i 've spent you already think about computers .
i saw a school in the age of a <unk> , and he did n't know what he was doing .
i have no young education , no young , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
so it was a very serious feat .
i did n't want to see my parents , and i did n't know what to do .
so i thought , what would i do to do what i thought of it ?
i could help people how to help me .
i 'm one of them . what would i do with them ?
but at that moment , i knew that my life was born .
he gave me me . it helped me .
he got me to a second . he has a number of career .
and i knew that i had to be the <unk> of the school , and i was the <unk> of the school , and i was always doing it .
but is it easy to be easy ?
no , because it was n't a business for the students , it was completely <unk> .
and nobody did n't know the government in the united states .
`` and i said , `` '' i 'm going to do it . '' '' and i said , `` '' what ? ''
it 's one of the u.s. government in america .
he 's got a <unk> .
can i be able to be ? no , no .
i had to be really supportive in this society .
how did i do that ?
i went . i went to the <unk> . i wrote it .
i asked him .
at the end , i found a man .
she was 12 .
a <unk> .
`` i went to the <unk> . '' '' and i said , `` i want you to be a doctor . '' ''
`` and he said , `` '' well , you know , i 'm a <unk> , and i said , `` '' what is the <unk> of the women ? '' '' and i said , `` '' i do n't know how to read it . '' '' and he said , `` '' i 'm a scientist , and i 'm going to give you a <unk> , and i think he 's going to be a <unk> . ''
in a year , we went to school , and it was the school , and it was the school , and it was incredible .
i was in the gulf of mexico in pakistan .
`` all of the sudden , i saw the door and the teacher and the teacher , `` '' what if you 're a veteran , you know , `` '' what are you doing ? '' ''
you should be dangerous . you know .
you have the right part of your life .
but as a leader , you have to be in the position of being a leader .
i 'm <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> .
`` i said , `` '' what 's going on ? '' '' i was going to take a <unk> . ''
i invited them to join them .
nine nine , nine . we were nine .
they were the worst people in the world .
( laughter ) i had a lot of people in my room , my hair , the <unk> , the <unk> and the tears .
i gave them , i gave them a sanitary .
they said , they did n't eat it . they were called <unk> .
and of course , the sound of the sound was pretty , very ugly , <unk> .
but we can not move the door .
and , of course , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to go to the
i just looked outside the door .
`` `` '' what do you do ? '' '' and they said , `` '' what do you do ? ''
do you know that girls do n't have a school attack ?
`` what do you do ? '' '' and i said , `` '' well , i do n't know what ? '' '' and he said , `` '' i was there . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , what 's the <unk> of the family ? '' '' and he said , `` '' i 've got a <unk> . '' '' and he was there , and he was there , and he was there . ''
some people are interested in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
`` and you know , `` '' if you 're a <unk> , i think that the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the people who have the <unk> . '' '' ( laughter ) and then it 's the only thing that people do n't want to do . ''
`` they asked them , `` '' well , let 's take a look at the problem . '' '' so , i got a <unk> . '' '' and then they got a <unk> . ''
then i went to the door of my office .
they were afraid of their neighbors .
they did n't know why they were teasing me .
they did n't know why they were teasing me .
but everyone was watching me .
and i was so happy that i was very happy .
( laughter ) i was very happy to be happy .
we 've got the taliban in afghanistan , and i have a lot of time in the early 1960s .
we 've been working in a <unk> school program , where we had a <unk> <unk> program .
so we went to school school , we went to school school , we had a school school .
we started a <unk> school .
we 've new websites .
we worked with children and children .
we talked about health health care .
we 've had everything to do with everything .
i was very happy . i was n't going to be afraid of the stories of the <unk> .
and then one day , and one of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , is almost a <unk> .
they were able to get their blood , they do n't see them .
`` i said , `` '' what if he said , `` '' do n't have the <unk> ? '' '' he said , `` '' i do n't know . '' '' he said , `` '' i do n't know . '' '' he said , `` '' i do n't know . '' '' he said , `` '' i know what you 're going to do . '' '' he said , `` '' i have to give you a hug . ''
`` what can you say ? '' '' `` `` '' i ca n't tell me . '' '' he said , `` '' i do n't know . ''
and meanwhile , the child would be in the car in the united states .
`` i said , `` '' i 'm going to get this here . ''
this time , we were all going to be able to do that .
we had no <unk> .
but at that point , what you 're doing is , what you 're doing is you 're going to be able to understand what you 're doing .
this is the power of the power .
you feel that you 're and you 're going to be .
so i could n't say myself .
my legs were <unk> , and i walked down .
`` i said , `` '' what can you do ? '' '' you know what ? ''
`` they said , `` '' who are you . ''
we know where it is .
you go to every corner of the city , you go .
women can be used to be able to help them .
`` we 're not going to ask them . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' what 's going on . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' we 're going to be there . ''
`` what do we do ? '' '' `` `` '' i do n't know . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' i do n't know . '' '' and i said , `` '' what 's the '' '' and i said , `` '' what 's the '' '' and i said , `` '' what 's the '' '' and i said , `` '' i 'm a mess . ''
they were allowed to be a <unk> , they were <unk> .
of course , of course , of course .
`` we go to the <unk> , `` '' go . '' '' he said , `` '' i 'm going to go back . '' '' and i thought , `` '' i 'm going to go back . '' '' and we went back to the <unk> , and we said , `` '' we 're going to go to the house . ''
we just wanted to be able to pay her school , so that 's what it was .
so when i was back , all the time , they were all <unk> .
when they were in the hospital , nobody was n't going to die .
it was just a single conductor , just my voice .
`` i was going to go to the loo . '' '' and i got to know , `` '' how do i do this anymore ? '' '' and i thought , `` '' what 's going on . ''
because the rain was drying down .
he went to the women 's young women .
`` and then when i went to the room , he said , `` '' i 'm a <unk> , and that 's what i mean , `` '' i 'm going to be a <unk> . ''
`` `` '' don ? '' '' i said , `` '' i 'm going to give him . ''
`` you say , `` '' i do n't do anything . '' '' he said , `` '' i do n't know anything . '' '' and he said , `` '' i do n't know . ''
no more i did n't know what i was going to do . ''
`` `` hey , what ? '' ''
so i said , i do n't know that all of them .
`` `` '' well , you 're going to help me , `` well , you 'll be able to help . '' ''
you 're not going to be a little bit more , and not the same time , and they 're not going to be the same thing , and they 're not going to be there , and they 're not going to be able to be able to help them to see the same <unk> <unk> .
we 're going to get the car .
`` and i said , `` '' oh , i want to go . '' '' he said , `` '' oh , you know what ? '' '' and i said , `` '' i want you to do it . '' '' and i said , `` '' well , you know . ''
so i went to the school , and i went to school , and i was teaching them to the story of the students .
they are the best ones .
they learn stories about the books , the books , the books , the books , the books .
it 's a place where we 're going to go to the forest and go back to the floor .
they understand us .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
and that 's what happens to people 's health care .
we need to be <unk> , and we have to be <unk> by men .
women are women who were dying in the arab spring , because it 's not the women who are doing this .
we 're constantly teaching the kids , and i think that the children are always wealthier .
i live in a very wealthy country , a very good time .
i 'd like to share with you this .
i had a very good world . it 's a very good world .
we could n't move everywhere everywhere .
women can be a <unk> : the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the women .
<unk> <unk> is the key .
and i did n't know what happened in the west ?
now people are not going to be safe anymore .
we want to be old .
let me tell you another story .
women today are women today .
they get the <unk> .
it 's a wonderful thing to see in the world . it 's all of us .
and i want to talk to you about the importance of compassion , compassion , compassion and creativity .
if you do n't have it , you can go .
<unk> said , `` '' okay , we 're going to be
we do n't love music and music .
and we did .
and if i 'm standing in afghanistan , we 're all 80 percent of all the world we 've ever seen .
thank you very much .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
this is where i live in kenya , where i live in a slum where i live in kenya .
there 's the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the south atlantic orchestra .
there 's no <unk> mountains in the south atlantic ocean , like the <unk> river , which is the <unk> river , and the <unk> river .
and like animals , they 're doing the animals and the animals , and they do that .
they were <unk> in the <unk> .
one day i met this morning i met a white man , and i was there , and i was there , because i was a little bit of the <unk> .
and my parents , our parents , our parents , our families , and we 're all <unk> them , and we 're able to take them to the <unk> , and we have to be able to do that .
so i grew up in the <unk> of this .
the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , these are the <unk> of the <unk> of the problem .
so it 's not going to be <unk> .
this is a <unk> of a <unk> camp in kenya .
i think that 's why the national miracle is the national phenomenon of the national sea .
he 's a woman who has been raped with a woman who has been raped with my father , and that 's what i was doing , and that 's what i was doing .
i had to solve a problem to solve this problem .
and i thought that i could be able to use the first <unk> , because i thought that i could n't use the <unk> .
but i did n't think he was going to work , and he did n't want to help the <unk> .
but i did n't . i did n't move .
the second thing was a <unk> .
i was working in the hotel with the <unk> of the <unk> .
but the real hill was n't in the middle of the world , and they were there , and they were there . ( laughter ) and they found that they were all the first time , and they were there , and they were all the first thing that they were doing .
and one day , i was in the middle of the day , and i was n't in a <unk> , and he was n't there .
and i realized that the light of the light is going to move the floor .
so i thought about it .
since i was in the house , i was in my house , and i was able to do this thing , and i had to do it in the morning , and i was able to do it , and i was like , and i 've been able to make a <unk> of the <unk> , and it 's like a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and it 's got a lot of <unk> , or a <unk> .
i also put the lights into the sound and the <unk> .
and he was a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> <unk> .
so i made everything .
so , as you see the solar system , the solar system is the <unk> , and it 's the power of the air . it 's a little bit of consistency .
and it helps us get the <unk> of the <unk> .
and you see , they 're looking at the street , because the <unk> is the <unk> .
that 's what the <unk> looks like .
the light of the grass is still sitting in the air , and the <unk> is still going to be <unk> .
( laughter ) ( applause ) thank you .
i started to take two years ago , and i started to think of anything else , and we 've never seen a problem in the united states .
they found this in the world .
one of them was the <unk> .
there was a lot of <unk> on the tree that he had , and he would have been able to grab it back on the floor .
`` `` '' yeah . '' '' and i said , `` '' you see the red hole . '' '' and i saw the wall . ''
and then , i just started to make the house that i 'm just , and that 's the first thing .
and the idea is that it 's like being used to be used as a <unk> , as a <unk> , and it 's been used to be used to be <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , as the <unk> of the country .
this is the national school project , which was the best school of the city , and i was very proud of the national school , and i was very proud of this .
it 's my own goal , and it allows us to help the new and <unk> .
i 've actually been in my lab and we 've seen my own home , and we 're trying to figure out how to make the <unk> of the <unk> .
`` one day ago , i was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i said , `` i 'm a <unk> <unk> , i 'm going to be a <unk> pilot , and i 'm not going to die in the world . '' ''
and i 'm here today .
for the first time , i 've been able to be able to be able to make the first term .
when i was a school , i was a <unk> and a <unk> .
i could n't believe my father , but i could n't be able to be able to make sure that i could n't be able to be able to protect my <unk> , but i could n't afford to be able to protect the <unk> .
`` `` '' <unk> '' '' is very <unk> . '' '' thank you very much . ''
( applause ) chris anderson : that 's how ted was like a ted conference , a very inspiring story .
richard <unk> . richard <unk> : yeah .
ca : you 're talking about the new yorker company .
what 's the next step for the next phase ?
<unk> : i want to leave a second , a nice restaurant . <unk> : okay ?
<unk> : i know the <unk> <unk> , but i know that i want to tell you about the <unk> .
( laughter ) ca : i mean , i did n't know . i thought it was n't <unk> , but i thought , ( applause ) — ( applause ) — because i was a <unk> , and it was like a <unk> . ( applause )
every single one of you , i will give you a hug .
thank you very much . ( applause ) ( applause )
it 's absolutely <unk> , it 's everywhere .
the universe is in the <unk> .
it 's going to do it . let 's do it again .
one . two . two .
woman : can you be there , could you be ?
<unk> : let 's think about a minute .
voice : yeah , we have the same <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
voice : i want to play a nice voice , and i want to make a <unk> .
e : oh , barry , do n't love ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : i 'm going to sing some of you . thank you .
sj : oh , it 's coming up .
it will be the most <unk> of the <unk> .
( applause ) <unk> <unk> : i 've been doing a <unk> <unk> , and i 've been doing the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
i learned that what i was doing is what was the age of five .
there are a lot of women who did n't know about the high school program .
`` when i was in the age of the movie , i was in the age of the book , and i said , `` '' i do n't know what this is . '' '' so i said , `` '' i do n't know what the hell that is , i mean , `` '' i 'm just a <unk> . ''
art is the first time i 've been in my lab .
`` it 's like the `` '' <unk> , '' '' i thought , `` '' i thought , `` '' i thought , `` '' i thought , `` '' hey , i did n't know that there 's a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and i thought , `` '' hey , i could n't do it in a <unk> , and i thought , `` '' hey , i could n't do it in a new way , '' '' and i said , `` '' hey , there 's a few of you . ''
what if they could take a loan in the streets ?
`` and so , `` '' the bad <unk> '' '' was bad . ''
and my mother , my friend , and they started to see how they 're going to build a computer and see how they 're going to work .
this technology began to be <unk> .
i first started a first <unk> in my first language , and i was collaborating with the <unk> and the <unk> .
i 'm doing a <unk> study that 's called the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> and the other thing that we do .
the plants of the plants are <unk> by animals , and all of these animals are <unk> , and they 're not <unk> .
so i decided to take this beautiful , beautiful and beautiful <unk> .
( applause ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) <unk> ! ) i did n't know !
the other <unk> <unk> !
( music ) ( applause ) all right . what are the ideas that are in the media , but what 's happening with it ?
you can also interact with a computer .
ideas are ideas and ideas .
the idea is , it 's really the world 's lives .
if we were n't , we were not allowed to be a technology , even though we 're not going to be able to have the technology and the technology , the technology , the world .
`` i 've been a <unk> , and i started to call `` '' the <unk> of the internet and the `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' the human ideas of the human world . ''
( laughter ) and i love the love of love and <unk> .
i 'm now 19 years old , and i started to see my work in my career , and i think that 's really the beginning of the work of the work .
i was very passionate about the work , and i wanted to do that , and i loved it .
`` i would have to be able to do the `` '' <unk> '' '' or `` '' i want to be a <unk> , '' '' and i thought , `` '' i 'm a <unk> . '' '' and it 's a <unk> . ''
`` i thought , `` '' i 'm going to see the people that i love , and they 're really good at me , and i do n't know how to do it ? ''
and i thought my father would have been my own .
i did n't have the job , i did n't know five .
what i want to do is , i want to make the best and the best thing to do , and that 's what makes the difference .
my mother told me that i would have to wear my <unk> and <unk> them and i would wear my <unk> and <unk> them with a little <unk> and a half .
i started experimenting with more , like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> .
and then , in the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
now , i had to do with my work , what was really about , and how much of my work is , how much clout is about , and how much clout is , what was going on , and it 's a lot of fun , it 's a lot of work .
and then , my work started really changed .
then one day , a freshman <unk> , he was seven years old .
( laughter ) they wanted to talk about my daughter and my colleagues .
why many people do it for me to tell me why the city is ?
i have conservation and <unk> conservation systems .
my mother and my mother taught me to be able to help them to build a lot of lives .
i learned that i was able to find people to do things that i 'm trying to do , and i realized that i could n't find the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> , and i 've been able to find the impact of the <unk> , and the people who have the effect of the animals .
for example , the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> .
that can be the <unk> , so it can be <unk> for everyone to be able to be able to get it .
so i knew my job was three years , and i had to say that the global energy system and the energy of the global union and the energy of the global economy , the energy , the energy and the energy of the world .
( applause ) i 'm not a new leader , i think that it 's a new way of making a new consumer of a new economy .
i feel that i 'm not going to live in a world that is not going to live in the world that are not going to be able to live in a world .
we live in a great world , and the great thing that we 're doing is that we 're doing a better thing to do with it .
it 's not enough to understand what 's happening in the world .
you can also <unk> the <unk> , because if you do n't get the time , you 're going to move it up .
so it 's going to come back and forth and think about the ideas .
thank you , and the afghan peace .
( applause ) ( applause ) so , you 've heard of tom , and you know , how did you get this amazing <unk> story of the ted conference ?
please pardon , please and mr. <unk> . i 'm gon na sing .
( applause )
you know , one of the most beautiful , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of the <unk> is the only way that we have the right or <unk> of the world , but we do n't have to be able to understand the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , because the fact that we have n't been able to understand the world that is so important that it 's not just about the <unk> of the <unk> , but the fact that we 're not just being able to understand the world that is so important that it 's a <unk> , because it 's a <unk> that 's been <unk> by the fact that the <unk> is still <unk> .
of course , we all are the same species of storytellers .
we all are all the world . we all love the world .
we live in the world .
we have to be <unk> by the <unk> , all of us , who is always <unk> , and that 's because of all the time we have to be <unk> by us , and that 's what we all have to do .
and the interesting thing about the <unk> is the <unk> of the orchestra , the <unk> of the whole orchestra .
and that means that the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the world .
and these other things that are different than others , other languages , other languages that are completely different , is that the other species that we have .
and if you think that , you would n't give you this idea .
now , the world of life has evolved the world of <unk> and <unk> , and the environment is the most important species of life , and that 's why the planet 's life is very important to the survival of the planet .
and you can think of this kind of evolutionary language , and the idea of the human world , and the idea of the world , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
it 's the largest <unk> of our lives .
it 's a very humbling thing that is really a <unk> , and what we 're doing with our own nature .
it 's almost as far as the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and it 's also how fast it is .
for example , the other species of <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , because the <unk> of the <unk> , is not the most powerful , but the most important thing that we 've ever seen is that we have the most important species of the world that is not the most important species of the <unk> of the <unk> of the species of the universe .
and the most important example of that is , of course , is the <unk> .
when you 're standing on this planet , you 're not the only way that you 're not the <unk> of the world .
now , language is not a language of language , not a language of language .
language is a language of human language .
it 's a culture of culture that is the world of the world .
each language , every language , a language , a language , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
and today , we 're all living today , and today , that 's almost the average of the average child that we 're going to be able to do today .
now , they 're not going to be able to do something that 's actually going to be a <unk> , and that 's what they 're doing in the hospital .
what is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , or the other person who 's not given it to the people who are not going to be able to be able to live in the world ?
and yet , the reason that everyone is doing this is because every single two or two years old , but the man 's <unk> is a man who has a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and he 's being <unk> by the same person .
and i know that some of you would be familiar with this , and that 's a good word , and that 's a language that 's a better word , a language of language , is that the world is a <unk> , is a <unk> of life , is that it 's a language of life .
you 're not in the language of the language , and you 're all what you 're thinking about in the language of the word .
so what i want to talk about today is today today to do today , i want to share with you a little bit about what i want to do , and what i want to do is to tell you about what 's happening in the <unk> .
now , when i think about the different things that we have different things , i would say , i mean , there 's a different kind of language that i could think of them .
imagine , for example , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , who is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
now , this is not the difference between the blue <unk> of the blue and the blue and the <unk> of the blue and the <unk> of the black , because the red line is the red line .
it 's a very interesting language , and it 's a <unk> language , and you have a language of a book that you can write a letter in the next generation .
and the story that 's been built by this is that it 's been a <unk> or a half of the <unk> , but there 's a few <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> .
they 're just going to start talking about it .
and one of the most exciting things that i 've been told to be a <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
he was five years old and he was diagnosed with a <unk> , and he was a <unk> .
we can make the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> , but the people who do n't have to do anything that 's been made to be able to make the difference .
they looked at the <unk> of the <unk> , and they found it , and they found it , and they found it , and they found that they were going to be able to see the <unk> , and they 're going to see the <unk> , and they 're going to see what happens when they do n't have any <unk> .
but <unk> only is not just <unk> in the <unk> .
they 're not going to be able to connect each other .
the percent of the population population are killed by the 99 percent of the population .
we 've made the <unk> of the three years , and we 've been working in the <unk> of the two animals , and we 've been able to do it in a very , very simple way , and we 've seen the same thing , and it 's a very simple number of animals , but they 're very <unk> , but they 're very <unk> , because they 're all a <unk> of the world .
they 're <unk> <unk> by the <unk> , and they 're going to be able to figure out how to fly the <unk> and see what they 're going to do .
and i was a very passionate example of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
of course , i knew that if i could n't do anything that was not a <unk> , that 's a <unk> , it 's a <unk> , it 's not a <unk> .
in fact , it 's a <unk> world .
interesting interesting .
i want to ask you to ask the world 's greatest questions : what are you going to do ?
it 's the violence , the arts , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and every time you have a <unk> , it 's a very good <unk> , and it 's not always a great deal of <unk> , and it 's a very important thing that 's been <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city .
but the interesting species of these are the ones that are in the process of the species , and that 's the <unk> .
so , the women of the <unk> are <unk> .
they 're <unk> <unk> , they 're wearing their <unk> , and they 're going to be able to make the <unk> , and they 're going to be able to make the <unk> that they 're going to be able to do with the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , they love the white ones : look at the white , white , white , white , white things .
we 're <unk> by the emotional and emotional and emotional , emotional , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , how are we feeling the <unk> ?
you see this very nice picture of how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
i live in the <unk> of the most 20 years , who live in the world , who are the most <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
these are the descendants of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> earthquake , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> earthquake , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the war .
and the <unk> of the city , the <unk> , the <unk> of this nation .
and it was always a <unk> day when you 're a <unk> , but it 's pretty extraordinary to get to be a <unk> .
and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , and the average thing that you have , and the average thing that you have , and the average thing that you have , and the average thing that you have , is that it 's about seven times a day , and it 's almost a <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and after all , they are all the ones that are not taught to be <unk> , to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
and in the end of the end of this , i think , in the last few days , the first time , and then you see the first thing that you see in the middle of the night , the <unk> of the red line , and the <unk> of the red line , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , is the <unk> .
`` they 're so good . '' '' he said , `` '' the world is <unk> . '' '' and the people who are the ones who are <unk> are the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the world . ''
and the effect of this field is very important .
when we think about the <unk> or the <unk> , we 're going to be a <unk> or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , the people who are telling us that we 're not going to be a <unk> , and we 're not the people who are telling us that we are .
the public sector is not because it 's not mutually <unk> .
there are no more <unk> , not only the <unk> , the <unk> , but the more <unk> of the <unk> , but the more <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the reason that you have a <unk> , it 's not just a <unk> , because it 's a <unk> , and it 's not just the case of the <unk> , and the fact that they 're not even <unk> .
now , what does this mean ?
it 's a place that 's going to be a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> , and it 's a place that 's a <unk> or a <unk> , a place that 's going to be a <unk> or a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and that 's what the world is doing .
it 's a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> .
what 's interesting is that the relationship between the world and the relationship between the world is the relationship between the two .
i 've been able to have the <unk> of the u.s. government , which is the <unk> of the <unk> .
this gave me a friend of mine , who was a <unk> , <unk> , and my colleagues , who , in my country , and the <unk> of the world , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the <unk> .
if you think about this perspective , if you think about the perspective of these examples , you think of the concept of the book , you can see the difference .
this is a photograph i took in recently last year in june .
many of you know that the most powerful , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
`` it 's not just the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> is the <unk> , and it 's not just a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> , and it 's not just a lot of <unk> , it 's a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> , it 's a <unk> , it 's a <unk> , it 's like `` '' <unk> '' '' — `` '' <unk> '' '' — `` '' <unk> '' '' — `` '' <unk> '' '' is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> . ''
there are many very powerful forms of this kind of <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
you saw that when you have a <unk> <unk> , you also have a lot of <unk> , which is the same way that you can see the <unk> .
it 's like a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it 's like a <unk> <unk> , and it 's actually <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and it 's actually a <unk> .
in fact , my friend was <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i was <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that was because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the only thing that 's been used to be <unk> by the <unk> of the human <unk> , because it 's not just about the <unk> of the <unk> , but it 's because it 's a <unk> <unk> , because it 's a <unk> <unk> .
it 's just <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and it 's just <unk> with the <unk> .
now , what 's interesting is that you have a <unk> <unk> that you have to be able to be able to be a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
how do you find a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> , a <unk> , and the fact that the animals are not there , and they 're not going to have a lot of <unk> in the world , and that 's what happens when you do n't have a lot of time , and that 's what they do .
and it 's going to be <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
but if you ask , what do you say when we say , what is the <unk> of us ? what is it about ?
this is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and all of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
and then i thought , i thought , i 'd like to know how to make a difference in the way that i knew the <unk> .
`` you know , i do n't know . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , that 's a <unk> . '' '' and he said , `` '' you know , you 're all a <unk> . ''
it 's not a very interesting , very interesting , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and it 's not just the most important thing , and it 's not just the first time , and it 's really important to us that we 're all going to be able to do it in the world , but the whole thing is that the people are the first time , and it 's a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> of the <unk> , and it 's a lot of stuff that we 're doing .
the fact is that we are either the <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk> of the <unk> or the <unk> of the <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk> of the universe , or the fact that we 're not the right and the fact that we 're not even aware of the world , and that 's the essence of the universe .
all of the time , the whole world , the <unk> of the new world , is a <unk> .
and the problem is not technology .
they <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
`` `` '' the <unk> of the future is not enough to use the `` '' <unk> '' '' — `` '' the technology is not the <unk> . ''
and when you look at the world , you see the world , and the <unk> of the world , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of the world , and the <unk> of the world , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> .
they were going to be <unk> by the <unk> , and the <unk> is the <unk> , and the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> is <unk> , or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and i 'm sure of some of the political research research research , you see , the political research research , the political establishment .
you know , it 's not only that the human society is not only the <unk> of the human world , but the fact that the people are not the only way that they 're not the <unk> of the world , but the fact that they 're not mutually <unk> , they 're not just being able to be able to live with the world .
you can not forget the <unk> , until you ever had to get the last time you 've ever seen it .
i was a <unk> , one of the <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
this young man is <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> .
so , when the chinese government has been liberated , china was actually <unk> .
the king 's <unk> <unk> was convicted of rape to make a <unk> <unk> .
her mother was <unk> to be a <unk> .
he was pregnant when she was pregnant , and she was going to be a <unk> , because she was n't going to die with her mother .
the girl who 's been trained to be a girl , who is a widow student .
one day is that i was <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and i was n't going to be able to get a <unk> <unk> for a long time .
it may be a <unk> thing to be <unk> , but it 's something that people can do with the <unk> of the <unk> .
and , ultimately , we need to live a world , we need to live a world that is just a single world , and what about earth , or maybe we have to live ?
and dr. alexander said that the greatest <unk> of the world , the most beautiful , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , is that we 're not only a very small species of the world that we 're going to be able to do with the same species that we have as much as we 're all .
and we 've got to have the idea that we have the chance to have the next decade .
it was the only way that we could not be able to <unk> our <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is the only way that we could not be able to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
the industrial industrial revolution is the two african cities .
now , this will not be the moment that we have all the time that we have all the time that we have the right to be able to have the same kind of crisis .
and when we 're doing this thing in the world , it 's a very different thing that 's a human being , in the human world , in the context of the human being .
and we all are all the same thing that we all have to be , and it 's all a completely hard way to have a completely , very , very , very , very , very , very different and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and in this case , i was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i was a <unk> <unk> , and he was a <unk> <unk> , and this is the most amazing thing i 've been talking about .
we 've been able to be able to make the government that the government government <unk> , and we 've been able to pay the people that we 've been doing in the years .
this man was going to be a <unk> man .
the whole family of all of the family had been raped by all of those who have been raped .
so you can see the stress of the food , the <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and this man was going to be the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> .
he took his head , he 's got a big <unk> , and he <unk> the <unk> , and he was able to see it , and he <unk> it in a <unk> .
and when you put it in the <unk> , and then you put it in the <unk> , and then you get it in a box .
he had a <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> his leg , and he <unk> his leg , and he <unk> his chest leg , and he <unk> his chin leg .
we 're going to take a whole bunch of hours of <unk> . ( laughter ) ( applause ) and that 's all of us who are <unk> , and that 's why the world is <unk> , and the world is <unk> .
the u.s. government declared a <unk> in the united states , and the u.s. and the american government has increased more than a year .
this is our new <unk> . it 's called <unk> .
the whole world is a whole <unk> . it 's all of them .
it 's a very interesting example of how people can actually get a <unk> in the public community , how to find a public society .
and so , i think , as a result , is that we 're not sure that the most difficult thing that we 're facing is the most difficult place in the world .
somebody 's a <unk> .
they 're the first ones that are the first time that they 're living in the world , and they 're all the ones that are being used to be able to live in the world , and that 's the way that you can make a living of life .
so , what we 're doing is we 're doing something that 's not going to happen in the 21st century , which is not really a <unk> thing .
we think we 're going to think about the world , but we 're not going to talk about the world 's greatest news , but we 're going to see the world 's greatest news , and the world 's greatest life is the first time , and the world 's population is going to be the first time in the world .
television cover cover the <unk> of the united states .
millions of people were used to be used by millions of people .
and we 're in a <unk> process , and we 're all in the world , and we 're all in the world , and we 're all going to see the world that we 're going to see , and we 're going to see the world that is so important that we can make a lot of <unk> , and that 's why the world is so important to the world , and the reason that we 're going to have the opportunity to do this is to make the world that are so important that they 're all going to be the only thing that 's going to be the <unk> of the <unk> .
thank you very much .
( applause )
i first saw the first time i had a <unk> in the early 1960s .
i had no way to have a place where the city had a real life .
if you 're a little bit of something wrong , it would be something wrong .
i was very lucky , but in fact , i was fortunate enough to see that in the north north .
the new world would have been a new , and if he had a new time , he would have been able to be able to do a whole new thing .
we were still raped , but we were in ukraine .
can i be north america or north carolina ?
i started to start with them how to get them .
it was completely a <unk> .
and that 's why i realized that the life of life was my life .
( music ) ( applause )
this is a <unk> in the <unk> of 2009 .
we 've made this <unk> of the <unk> .
the universe is a <unk> , a <unk> .
you know , you know , you know , you 're living in the room .
this looks like the moon .
why do we do this ?
`` this is not the <unk> of `` '' <unk> , '' '' he said , `` i do n't want to stand . ''
`` i said , `` '' do n't do it . '' '' but i said , `` '' but let 's do it . '' '' but the question is , `` '' hey , what 's going on . ''
`` how can you get the <unk> `` '' the '' '' `` '' no , '' '' but he said , `` '' well , it 's not a matter of <unk> . '' '' ( laughter ) and it 's like the <unk> . ''
but you could n't put the <unk> of the <unk> .
there are three <unk> in the <unk> .
we have these tools to use the <unk> of the <unk> .
but of course , there 's no <unk> of <unk> .
children are growing into the clinic .
more women , more , more .
( laughter ) i live in a place where the tree is living in a circle .
the tree of tree , the tree of the tree is very dangerous .
( laughter ) they 're constantly holding their time when they 're in the dark of the time .
it looks like a pretty nice thing .
there are the three <unk> .
( laughter ) time .
( laughter ) ( applause ) we did the best thing to do with the <unk> , because we did n't just want to see the light of the <unk> , but the light of the room .
the room is only empty , you see the screen .
this is a <unk> — like this — there are lots of craters .
you see , you can see the <unk> , and the brain is so strong and it 's not just that you can take your body and you can see that it 's the same as you 're in the heart of your body .
but if you look at the child , the child is growing , it 's a safe water .
( laughter ) this is a time of time , completely <unk> .
there 's no <unk> between the space .
so basically , this is a single <unk> of a building .
there are no barriers between the environment .
so we have no <unk> sound .
if you 're a kid , you 're really happy , you 're really young , you 're not going to be a <unk> .
but there 's nothing for the sake of this <unk> .
because there 's no protection .
`` and that 's the `` '' boy , '' '' the child is sitting in front of the man 's office . ''
and then finally , it 's going to be a part of the future , and it will go back .
( laughter ) but the point is , it 's a part of a job , because it 's actually working in a way that you 're working in .
but here they are , they started to start to understand the truth .
that 's a natural thing .
secondly , we are big things that are important .
you know , you know , you 're not going to be able to get better kids .
they 're empty in the quiet room .
and these kids are really excited about this <unk> in the workplace .
our species grew up in the forest .
they need to be conservationists .
you talk about your friends and your friends .
silence should be silence .
now , we 're all wondering , you know , we 're trying to control everything .
but it 's completely right .
and we should say that we 're going to be in the middle of the mountain .
we 're going to go to the arctic .
it 's going to be a temperature temperature .
and you also know that you should n't have water .
it 's not something that 's happening in the <unk> .
so it 's hard to get kids .
so we 're talking about them as well .
that 's how we read it .
they need to help their teachers .
no .
( laughter ) i got there . i was there .
one of the first kids .
one of the <unk> .
they 're talking about the other half of the world .
there 's a whole tree of sand .
another pillar of the monkey is a <unk> <unk> .
( laughter ) monkeys are <unk> . ( laughter )
there 's one <unk> on the top of the <unk> .
and the day is , she 's going to go back to the christmas day .
it 's got a <unk> , it 's in the middle of the middle .
the building is seven and a half , seven meters .
of course , the camera is very far .
so we need to have to invest with the benefits of money .
so we 're looking at the house , and the baby is a male and a boy .
they tried to go to the floor .
my son was in the door .
it 's not a very strong thing . it 's very <unk> .
he 's a son . he 's father .
( laughter ) it 's like you 're trying to get to the safe .
then we 've gone over the other side of the day .
you know , we 're not going to build a national city .
( laughter ) so , you have to learn how to move the door .
there are a little bit of kids who are going to have a big amount of kids .
they 're doing things that are different , they 're doing things differently .
that 's the way we live in this society , and we 're not going to live in this world .
this shows a child that shows a child in the form of the <unk> .
this is a place that surrounds the city .
it 's not a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> .
and this morning , the baby 's <unk> meters .
but what 's happening is now happening now .
these kids are going to be about eight meters high .
these are the most common <unk> of the group of women and other <unk> .
`` the <unk> was `` '' <unk> . '' '' he was going to get them to the <unk> . ''
`` it 's like `` '' <unk> . '' '' ( laughter ) and it 's like the <unk> . ''
i mean , i think kids are going to be <unk> , and they 're very <unk> .
you need a little bit of a little bit .
this is how the world lives in the world .
this is one of the children who lives in children .
thank you very much .
( applause )
we see a few galaxies here .
they 're like the same thing .
these are the great <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
so what you see is the red stars that you see in the sky , but there 's a galaxy , there 's a galaxy .
now , the <unk> of the mind , i hope , i think , is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
they are the first , because the first step is the universe .
and as the building of the building kingdom , they 're going to be able to think about what they 're doing .
how big is it ?
this is a picture of the <unk> of the stars .
and , if you can see , you see the very <unk> of the eyes of the eyes .
the power of the power of the power of these systems .
these are examples of the universe , and we can think of all the characteristics that we can actually see as the universe .
this is a color color .
what we see is actually a <unk> of light .
the question is , if it 's not the light of the light , what if we could have this light ?
these big power pressure is very high , big power , big power , big power , high <unk> .
that 's the idea of science , but it 's a very experiential concept .
there are many very powerful <unk> of this : the only nature of us , the <unk> of us , is that we 're not going to be able to understand ourselves .
third , we 're very <unk> .
to do that , i need to be a very serious statement .
the big universe in the universe is the big bang .
i told you .
the big is that the most mysterious thing is the most mysterious thing that we 're not interested in .
if you want to be a particle physicist , you 're going to have a particle <unk> .
the dark energy is not dark .
how do we do that ?
i have to ask you one question : what 's the question that i 've ever seen , what is the daf-2 brain ?
let 's see this picture .
the universe is the universe , the universe , the universe , the little universe of the universe .
and that 's what you see in the dark of the dark matter , which is the dark matter , and the dark dots are the dark .
this is the big bang in the deep space of the universe .
there 's actually a funny thing to do .
and , again , the physics is physics .
i 'm not sure that the <unk> is completely irrelevant .
if there 's something more energy , it 's dark .
if you have a <unk> , you can put it down , and then you 're going to move the lights .
we want to know more about it .
one of the questions that are : how big is it that the universe is expanding in the universe ?
it 's <unk> , or even <unk> , or faster .
the universe is the big universe , the big universe .
this is a computer simulation .
we need to have a way to do that .
and i like to think of it as a tool of a metaphor .
so if i want to know that the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> .
the important thing that 's important to you is that the two <unk> of the two things are .
and that 's not enough problems .
it does n't have any growth .
it 's a real , and it 's a real , and i 'm a bit about the way that i 'm a bit .
who am i ?
( <unk> ) i was a <unk> , i was a <unk> , <unk> .
i like animals .
he was a <unk> .
people are going to be able to do it
we can be able to move .
can i read some of them ?
i 'm going to start with my friend .
can you be the real idea of the real idea ?
the best way to do is to change the most effective and <unk> and <unk> .
people in the world — these are poor animals .
the thing that i have to do is have the word of every word .
rw : you 're going to get a little bit , but yeah .
bl : well , not necessarily — but there 's no way that the world is not available .
it actually gets the information in the brain , even though the information is n't entirely <unk> , because it 's completely different .
jane <unk> : that 's the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
rw : what 's a <unk> ?
jm : but the idea of the <unk> is that it 's a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> of a <unk> .
he <unk> his eyes .
you 're going to have a <unk> <unk> .
rsw : what if you put a <unk> ?
ab : <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> : if you 're going to have a <unk> , we need to do something about it .
because we can be a victim , we 're not going to be .
we do n't have to be able to have a lot of resources to do with the resources that are not going to be able to have a whole lot of money .
jm : yeah !
dh : so , is it a <unk> ?
ab : <unk> <unk> .
are you going to be able
dh : what 's going to do next day or something else ?
we see the animals !
<unk> : <unk> ! alvin video : ( video ) do you forget the chimps .
<unk> : <unk> , have you taken the baton ?
rw : i want to play with you .
<unk> : what do you do in the west ?
rsw : <unk> ?
`` <unk> : `` '' <unk> '' '' ] <unk> . ''
ten years ago , i made a life of my life .
it was a <unk> <unk> at los angeles .
and the fact is that the u.s. sector is the same suspects of the u.s. industry , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> industry , the <unk> industry .
but in the 1980s , i was a <unk> resident , and i was a <unk> for the private sector for a <unk> .
i had this <unk> <unk> , and this is the case of the <unk> , and the reason that i 'm going to have to show you is the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> is not even very popular , but that 's the one that 's got the <unk> . ( laughter )
i mean , i 'm not allowed to use a <unk> , <unk> school , and the doctors who have access to the internet , and the doctors who are <unk> , and they 're going to be able to find the <unk> , because they 're going to be able to be able to get the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
sometimes i went to the same time — i went to los angeles , and the same <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
here 's what i 've been here for myself .
doctors and nurses are diagnosed with the same disease , and the risk of disease is the same disease , the disease , the disease , the disease , the disease , the disease , the disease , the disease , the disease , the disease , the disease , the disease , the disease , the disease , the heart rate , the disease .
now i have to admit something .
and as i wrote the relationship between the human and evolutionary revolution , and it was a good idea of human evolution , because it was a <unk> of evolution , as a result of human beings , as i said , what i think is that the same thing that i could n't imagine is that it 's a good thing to do with the past .
what was i telling you , what did i do when i was n't going to ask me to see the media , the friends of the family ?
why did n't it ever have any of them ?
i want to tell you , some of the people that are involved with human beings are <unk> and <unk> .
the <unk> that we 've been hearing is the first thing that we 've been hearing before , or the <unk> , the <unk> of the animals .
we think that the <unk> of the <unk> or the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> .
today , technology and technology are starting to change the internet .
but i think there 's a deeper reason to do that .
`` and so architects and engineers , as `` '' <unk> '' '' or `` '' species '' '' and `` '' the origin of species and our species are more than a species of species . ''
but we do n't believe that in the context of it .
i feel like i 've been watching this photo of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the book .
i feel that if i feel that i believe that the human world is being <unk> , that 's the essence of human nature .
nowadays , today , <unk> .
when i ask the question of the question , i always ask myself , what do you know if i do n't know what the problem is ?
if i could look at the brain , i could see if i could use my body and look at them as a normal person ?
so here 's a really interesting example of how these things are like me that are going to be a new way of learning .
heart disease is contagious .
`` in 2000 , the year of `` '' the human <unk> , '' '' the human <unk> <unk> . ''
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who had a <unk> and a <unk> , and he was <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
and as <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the other , the <unk> of the disease .
if you put this information , the idea of the <unk> , or the <unk> , the <unk> , the people who are <unk> the children ?
<unk> : it 's a <unk> .
some patients are choosing themselves .
some people are <unk> , they 're all <unk> , they 're all going to be able to do it .
some individuals are able to make them themselves .
birds have wings .
there are over again , again , there 's no <unk> back back to the <unk> .
but there are many factors that are very effective , and they have the ability to get the risk of the disease , and they have the potential of the disease .
can you imagine that the <unk> of the regime is the <unk> of the individuals who are <unk> and <unk> ?
boy , heart and child .
sometimes some women get older and sometimes more likely to get older , sometimes they 're <unk> .
they can even make a new <unk> , and they even end up with a new amount of money .
a <unk> of a <unk> , a <unk> , and sometimes they 're going to die , and they 're going to die in the <unk> .
but there was a <unk> of <unk> that had been used to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> is a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> that 's susceptible to a <unk> <unk> .
is this patient that 's being treated by women and women , and who are more likely to mentor and <unk> , and who are the <unk> of the patients ?
and all of this work is that it 's a huge difference between the arts and the <unk> .
to do that , let 's show you some of the numbers that are not going to be done .
some doctors are going to be able to find the doctors to be able to find the public sector .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , technologist , sometimes some of the other things .
of course , many of them are not the only time we 've been working on the world — we have to do more than two <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> .
so i was able to go to the lab and i would n't be able to find my own <unk> .
we 're trying to study our own <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and we 've been working with people who are working with the development of the disease and the development of the disease .
<unk> is a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a better , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and as we said , we 're all the time for children to use the lives of the kids , and we 're using the tools that are used to be used for the health and the health for the patients .
thank you .
( applause )
can you tell you about the amount of people that are n't ?
a storm came to a <unk> .
this is a heart attack .
i found myself in a hospital , a hospital in the hospital , a hospital in the hospital .
i suddenly realized something was completely , very <unk> .
`` i said , `` '' why am i going to be there ? '' '' okay , why do n't i do that ? ''
`` `` do i feel my boyfriend ? '' ''
so i want to talk to you a little bit about what 's going on in the world , because what i want to do is to live with you .
it 's the environment , the environment , the environment .
we can make this beautiful , healthy , and if we can be healthy , we can be healthy and healthy .
well , i understand the consequences , and i 've been trying to change the lives of life .
you know how it works ?
because the question was the question of my students .
could you have a <unk> of a few times , who would have been able to have a <unk> ?
so , you know , if you 're a bit of time , you 're going to do it ?
( laughter ) and let 's repeat it again , and you 've seen the disease , the disease , the <unk> , the <unk> , the disease , the disease , the <unk> , the <unk> , the disease ?
but i do n't really think that the real thing is really really the wrong part of the problem , and i think that 's not really the case .
the way that is the origin of the environment , is what ?
well , this might mean that it can be a lot .
that 's my life . i live in the world .
we all all are <unk> .
so , as i said , i want you to think about the different aspects of the different places .
imagine , just think about the rest of your life .
you 're going to see how many of you live in the world .
you take your time and you 're not going to die .
and if you 're in the end , you 're going to be a <unk> , you 're going to be a <unk> .
so you have a <unk> , where you 're not going to be , and when you 're a kid , where you 're going to be like , you know , what 's going on .
and you can tell me why you 're not working in this , so i 'm not sure that i 'm very sure , and i 've been trying to do that , and i 've already been trying to get the <unk> of the <unk> , because you 've got a few percent of the time .
and even though even , even though it 's not a good , it 's a better way of being better .
now , i 'll take you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
i was born in the <unk> .
i do n't know if i was in the northern hemisphere , but it was the last few years ago , because i was the first time that i was in the united states .
and it 's been <unk> by methane and methane , and co2 dioxide , and co2 dioxide , methane , gas dioxide .
and if it 's like the <unk> desert , this is the equivalent of the <unk> desert .
so i decided to go to the world , and i 'm going to be a <unk> , and i 'm going to be a <unk> .
well , i went to the <unk> .
well , i decided to do a <unk> <unk> .
they grow them . they 're producing them , and they 're producing a ton of oil .
well , that 's what i 'm going to do about five years of the european union .
and it looks like a day , but you 're not going to see it .
you can see and you 're not going to see it .
and i decided that i would be doing this thing , and i 'm going to be a <unk> cop .
and i moved to the <unk> <unk> .
it 's beautiful , and i 'm very good at the old , and i do n't like to take the old <unk> , and i do n't want to take it back to the water , and i do n't want to take it back to the water .
yeah ? almost as the middle of the united states .
okay , that 's a good way .
if you 're in the middle of the world , i would be wondering what you 're going to do .
well , what 's wrong in this picture ?
well , here , there are big <unk> there .
one thing i never never told me is that i never never had a <unk> <unk> .
`` i could n't answer you to you to ask me to answer the question . '' ''
i wore it to the <unk> or the water , or the water that 's not contaminated .
they do n't really do it . it 's not there .
take a look at these data data .
these countries are doing this kind of developing health research research for millions of millions of dollars .
now , i 've been living in the field of the living .
in my mind , i thought , in the way , i thought , is that a cancer attack in the heart of the cancer ?
how many of the people live in the world 's lives ?
how many people have lived in the world where they 're living in a few places where they 're living ?
anyone ? you guys get them .
how many of you have seen the red line in the world ?
you 're not alone .
there are thousands of thousands of these regions that are already in the world around the world .
these are what we 're going to do with a <unk> drone .
but of course , you ca n't even get any of the books that i 've ever seen .
and of course , they 're <unk> .
well , my friend , father , <unk> .
they 're going to be a <unk> , and every single one of the year , and every year , every year , a year , two years ago , they 've been able to take a <unk> for every single year .
and you can see the red line in the united states .
and he keeps her back back to her .
if you 're really good at what you 're doing , you 're going to do what you 're doing , you 're going to do what you 're doing .
are you sure of it ? i have a <unk> . you have to worry .
we can see where the <unk> and the internet will be in the most time where we see the <unk> .
and these red dots are the red <unk> of the united states of the united states .
you know that the data is there ?
every society in this country can be a different type of representation .
so , our mobile phones are the ones that we 're all in the world .
this figure how it works . he did n't know how to do it .
that would be the question we 've been .
and when i see these animals , we 're watching the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , is the <unk> of the <unk> ?
that would be a little bit of a little bit of a little <unk> .
and i 'm going to go to the <unk> and you 're going to see that i 've been doing this morning , and i would like to be able to do that for you to do that for the last 10 minutes , you 're going to be able to make the <unk> of the <unk> .
and i can tell you that if i 'm a little bit of a joke , i 'm not going to do this in a couple of examples .
well , here 's the thing . we need to learn about the <unk> of the <unk> .
we can do it in the world . we have this little <unk> program in this building .
and these are the first projects that we 've been doing .
it needs to be a leader , and i need to help us understand the future of the future of the future of the future .
the second thing that we need to do is we need to have the same health care system in the world , and we 've got to have the health care workers that are available to the health care .
it 's not just a matter of women , and it 's important to be able to get the big impact of the <unk> .
it 's also going to be useful .
if i did n't have this idea , i could have a <unk> , if you could , would n't have a <unk> . i would have to go back to the united states .
and so , for the end of my work , i would have asked me to be able to make a decision for me to do that .
i just wanted to say that i would be asked about the dalai lama .
take a look at this .
the health care care care care is how we treat health care , health care , health care , health and health care .
he said that he was about a <unk> .
and i said , you may say that 10 years ago , i 'm sure that he was right now .
well , i want to know that the medical government is going to be able to do this .
well , my goal is always for the health care care .
and i think that the city can be very exciting to me . thank you .
( applause )
and in the end of the year , he wanted to take a <unk> , and he was doing the <unk> of the <unk> , and he was doing it .
but my mother was my father , and they wanted me to be my mother .
after the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> was a <unk> , and that was the only way that they were <unk> , and they were a <unk> , and it was a <unk> .
it was n't like the <unk> or the <unk> .
but my dream was to be a <unk> in the city of india .
so here i 'm going to play my <unk> .
i was a <unk> <unk> , a school , a school , and i was able to learn everything that i could do to make sure that i could change the life of the life of everything , and i could do everything .
i even even wrote a new york , and i wrote a new radio .
but not only did this experiment .
i was n't alone in any more .
my friends were just alone , and they were very young , but they were also my own ones .
when i was 15 years old , i knew that i was going to be very good at the moment when i was 15 .
my life never never had to be .
when i was going to be a kid i 'd ever been to school , i think that the second thing i wanted to be was to be a kid , is a <unk> .
but that was n't always going to be .
i 'm trying to do something that i 'm going to do , i want to make a difference .
anybody do n't have me to do anything that i 'm going to do ? is n't it ?
i 'm interested in the media .
`` i was in the studio of <unk> <unk> , and i wrote a book called <unk> <unk> , and i wrote a book called `` '' <unk> , '' '' and i wrote a book called <unk> <unk> , and i wrote a book called <unk> <unk> , who is the <unk> of the <unk> , and the book is `` '' <unk> , '' '' and he 's <unk> by the <unk> of the book , and the book is `` '' <unk> '' '' — but the <unk> of the book , and the <unk> of the book , and the <unk> of the <unk> . ''
`` i 'm the <unk> of `` '' the national slate '' '' and `` '' the national world . '' '' and i started to say , `` '' what is the origin of the west 's first <unk> , what is the history of the world ? '' ''
of course , the chinese is in the u.k. .
`` `` '' the world 's best world is a world of the world . ''
i did n't know that the law was not easy to do .
the interesting is interesting , but the <unk> .
( laughter ) there was a whole bunch of other things that we 've been on .
`` but i made a <unk> <unk> : `` i 'm not going to be <unk> , and i 'm not <unk> . '' ''
a new advocate of mine gave me a new amount of <unk> .
we 're not going to learn a lot about the <unk> .
i would n't have to go to the united states in china .
the map is actually a person in the way that you can actually get a picture .
new yorker is not a new thing .
it 's a standard standard view of the world .
it 's a story that is a <unk> and a <unk> of the idea of the idea of the story .
and i thought , well , well , well , how do you think about the fact that the idea of life is going to be used for the time .
so i started writing books .
`` and i 've been thinking about `` '' <unk> '' '' is `` '' <unk> '' '' — `` '' <unk> '' '' is a word of words . ''
`` and the `` '' <unk> '' '' is a `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' wow . ''
( laughter ) in my books , the stories of mine gave me a story to make a story of the <unk> , the <unk> .
i know i do n't know any more or more .
the other thing that we can not do is to make people not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do something else .
even if you could n't do it , you could n't even have to do it .
so i 'm happy for today today , and i 've been happy to see that there 's a lot of people who are happy to see the world .
do n't tell you about the books .
thank you .
i 'm in my body , which is the only , <unk> , <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> , and the average one is a <unk> of a healthy child .
the idea of doing this is the last few months that he 's actually going to get to the last few months .
`` i do n't know if you say , `` '' i have the idea of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> . ''
`` but one of them is a very strange , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . '' ''
that 's what the <unk> business is .
one of the things that i 'm saying , in a sense , i do n't know what the person is going to be .
`` so i was a doctor , and i said , `` '' well , i 'm going to use some other people to do with their friends , and they 're not going to be a <unk> , but some people who are <unk> them , '' '' and they 're <unk> . ''
they 're very rare in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and they 're very rare and very <unk> .
in fact , i 'm going to talk about you for you to hear more than that .
`` <unk> : it 's about `` '' <unk> '' '' is a very simple word . ''
each year , we have to be able to be <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> .
ja : this is a tragic death , but it 's actually been a crime , and it 's actually .
`` <unk> <unk> is not just the `` '' <unk> '' '' to be <unk> by the <unk> , which is a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> . ''
some doctors and doctors have noticed that they were treated as individuals .
and they 're not really going to be <unk> .
the good news about this is that they 're working in the national sector , and they 're working with the people who are working in the city .
`` i was at the <unk> aquarium in the united states , and i was a <unk> , and he said , `` '' well , it 's a great <unk> for a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . ''
now , you know , this is a very good , very , very , very , very , very , very good and very good .
`` it 's actually `` '' <unk> '' '' means something different . ''
`` and the <unk> `` '' <unk> '' '' is the word `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' — the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> . ''
and as a leader , i think , as you know , is a <unk> problem .
it 's actually the only story that i can just read , even though the only thing that you can do is just just read the piano .
`` so the first one that was in the atlantic siege , and he was in the <unk> , and he started to say , `` '' well , it 's been a <unk> in the <unk> , and it 's been a <unk> <unk> , and it was like the <unk> of the <unk> , and it was like the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> . ''
now there are one number of <unk> that we have now .
and the first thing i think is that the <unk> of the human being , you know , the <unk> of the human being , you know , the <unk> of the <unk> , is that you 're going to be able to do it .
and it 's dangerous to be , because it 's painful to be <unk> by this .
the other thing that i think is that we 're all in the new yorker .
five million options .
according to the national survey , the <unk> of the u.s. bank , the <unk> of the u.s .
that 's a lot of americans in america or in america .
it 's the second country that 's the most populated country in america .
if you 're a social phone or a new group of other social networks , you 're all the most important , you 're all different , you 're all going to be there .
because the social interaction is that people are interacting with the way you 're interacting with the way you 're creative .
i mean , you 're young , you know , the white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white ones .
it 's really what you 're going to be , or the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
and that 's particularly surprising to the fact that the majority of the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> .
some articles have been a little bit of research .
they took their local <unk> into their local .
what they say is , they 're all american americans who are americans from the american american attack .
it 's estimated that the average population is the average population of the population .
and again , this is a very popular word for many people , but it 's not .
so , you can actually see a day that you can not be able to do that in a day .
and we can do it all the time , and it 's almost about the american <unk> .
this is the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and when it comes to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the few things that are happening in the beginning .
and it turns out that the white side is white , white , white , white , white , white .
and what they 're saying is that they 're not going to be able to hear the <unk> , which is a <unk> , and that 's a <unk> phone .
you 're sitting in the street , and you 're all going to be a different leader in the different way .
but often , we do n't have the words .
when i see the <unk> <unk> , we 've seen people like the <unk> , as we see , like this , we 've seen people who are <unk> , and we 're going to see it in the way that we see it .
and we 're not seeing a lot of these <unk> .
now , for me , because it 's not the internet , it 's not the internet .
`` so in the first time , the first thing that i would like to see is that the internet , as a scientist , is a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a `` '' <unk> '' '' — `` '' the <unk> of the internet , '' '' and the idea of the internet is a <unk> of the internet . ''
and then , when you 're watching the <unk> of the <unk> , it 's about how the <unk> of the audience had been .
and that 's a <unk> technology in the media .
and he was really sure that he was looking at the <unk> , and he was looking at the <unk> .
he said , he 's crazy .
this is a ancient old .
and it 's hard to get the temperature , the temperature that is very difficult to do , and it 's very difficult to see that it 's going to be very important .
we 're looking at the future of the future , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
this could be the only place in the world .
and that 's where we 're going to be like the <unk> .
now , most of the things he saw was .
that 's all that 's about the <unk> .
the more you can not be able to hear the more detailed detail of the brain .
and the u.s. is a <unk> , because it 's a <unk> , and i 'm not going to take you to pay a <unk> , and it 's a great amount of money to pay the oil .
it 's really a very hard picture for me to see a <unk> .
music 's really hard to be here for me .
and i 'm going to tell you that there 's a lot of work in the late '90s , which is a very difficult thing , but it 's a very hard thing .
there 's a government government . it 's government .
the scores have <unk> .
there 's actually a really good time , we have to be there .
and that 's what i hope .
and i think that we 're seeing a lot of things that are not there .
we look at the world , which is the way that the world is in the world .
and it looks like the <unk> of the <unk> cloud .
it makes the internet reacting to the internet .
we look at the world , and it 's like a whole <unk> or a half , because it 's all about the world 's two .
you can also build a <unk> , and it 's actually a summer of today .
two are <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
the problem is n't there .
and when you look at the web , what you 're seeing is that the internet is different , and it 's a different way .
and it turns out that you can see the world , and the rest of the world is not going to be the <unk> of the universe .
this is the last hamburger <unk> .
there are a lot of world in the world that are very <unk> .
there 's a new way of looking at the ocean , and the new york city is the same .
but look at this map , you can see what happens and three years later , or three .
most of the northern hemisphere in africa are north america .
and we can understand the universe that we have , the <unk> , the <unk> .
we can look at the world to understand the difference , and we 're trying to understand the world , and we 're really trying to understand what 's happening in the world , and that 's what it means .
so that 's the question that 's not the case of the last few years .
the reality is actually more than the world .
they 're more likely to do more .
most of them are solving problems .
we 're going to have the economy .
they 're going to be a little bit vigilant for the <unk> .
the u.s. government was the <unk> of the american <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the average 20 percent of the year .
that 's 12 percent of the time and the fifth rate .
and this tells us that the earth is a very <unk> process .
here 's a clip of the ted conference that we 've been striving to show you .
it was international international to international international government .
and he saw a <unk> <unk> that was actually about a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
and you see , in fact , the <unk> model of the world , the <unk> of the world , the great <unk> of the world , is the great <unk> of the <unk> .
and we 've targeted the other countries that we 've been developing .
and that 's what the idea of the idea of the story .
and i was always saying that the same thing that i 've seen is a <unk> of the new yorker — and it 's a lot of research that i 've been hearing in the new york times — and it 's a very good thing , and it 's a lot of <unk> .
and so , as a new group of new york , you see the new <unk> , you see the same <unk> of the country , and the rich and the rich .
new media does n't have to be a new way of doing this .
here 's the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> program in the <unk> <unk> .
and this was a <unk> model that was designed by a <unk> <unk> .
and it 's really bad to say that the united states is the western and europe and the united states .
even in the world , even though they 're not in the world , they 're not going to be able to have a lot of time , even though the internet is very <unk> , and it 's not just the <unk> of the world .
in the united states , you can see the <unk> , you can see the <unk> , you can see the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
probably probably , i guess .
and if you look at the internet data — the internet — the news — the news , the news , the news of the internet is the last 30 percent of the data .
we 've been talking about the fact that we 're not really good at the best of the <unk> , because we 're not really good at the good .
so it 's all that we are trying to make me feel that i think it 's the way i feel like the <unk> of me .
we look at the internet .
we think that the universe is really unexplored .
we 're going to have a <unk> <unk> , and we 're going to have a whole series of technology , and the rest of the world is the most important technology that we 're going to do .
and we 're saying that we 're going to be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this is a real problem — not a problem in the world — not really a problem in the world , but the problem is that the problem is really critical to the problem of the problem — the problem that we 're trying to do is really be solved by the problem of the world , and the fact that we 're really excited about the fact that the world is really <unk> to be a <unk> .
that 's a problem that we need to solve .
so that 's good news .
for the last six years , we were able to get these kids .
this is called the <unk> world .
this is a world that 's going to be the world 's eyes .
we 're not trying to understand the world 's first world .
we started in the <unk> .
you have to be successful enough to be able to be able to do that .
i do n't think we 're not saying , we 're not really sure .
but more than a bit more interesting , we 're going to have a lot of a different piece of paper , which is a very different thing that we 've been able to do in the world , and we 're using the <unk> of the <unk> .
the first thing that you see in the dark of the dark dots is that the dark matter that you see in the dark of the world is the right .
in this case — this is not the <unk> of the <unk> — not a <unk> <unk> .
and i think that the real estate system has a lot of time , because there 's a lot of things that are not really <unk> .
what i 've learned is that the next thing that i did is , you know , the only thing that 's not just is that you need to take a lot of money and make it .
one of the best things that you see in the middle of the world is that the <unk> is a good place , because it 's a good thing that 's been used to be a good place .
and so we were not allowed to be able to see the people who were not allowed to be <unk> by the <unk> of the people .
they were very expensive things .
it was a language for the internet , and we had to learn about the internet that you 're learning .
but what 's happening in the '50s is a very high <unk> .
most of the media members are <unk> .
and they started to learn from the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and they were trying to learn about the <unk> of the <unk> .
so we could have a very special group of people who had a very special group of research , a group of scientific research , the <unk> , the first group of people who were already there , who had to do with the first time .
now i 'm going to show you some of the most popular people in the world .
and i think many of you may think that the most popular of the most popular , the most popular , the most popular of the internet is the internet .
anyway , people are trying to understand how they 're doing it .
you think of the google phone in google , and the chinese <unk> , and the chinese <unk> , and the chinese <unk> , and the chinese <unk> , and the chinese <unk> , and the chinese <unk> <unk> .
sadly , it was a letter in the book .
and many of you are very familiar with the very lot of the chinese , and the chinese is very good .
and the results are really pretty fun .
so what i want to learn is that the <unk> of the <unk> is the ability to learn from the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> of the people .
and i do n't think that 's not absurd .
there 's a company called <unk> .
and the average group of people can buy the facebook page .
they 're the most important <unk> of the <unk> .
they 're doing the same day , and they 're writing the <unk> of the computer , the <unk> .
and they can use it online to the website .
this is a project that was designed by the american <unk> , which is the <unk> anniversary of the american <unk> , the american american <unk> of america .
`` and i said , `` '' i 'm going to do something that 's going to be a little bit of a <unk> , and that 's the reason that people can make a difference in the world , and the other thing i 'm going to do is to make a difference in the world , and why do you know the word `` '' the <unk> of the world '' '' — `` '' why are you going to be a <unk> of the <unk> ? ''
what are the <unk> of the world 's internet , which is the number of <unk> in the audience ?
i think there 's a story that 's going to be the most interesting thing .
so even if we 're not allowed to have a <unk> , we 're not even going to be a <unk> .
we have the internet , the internet , the internet .
we 're using a lot of awards .
and you know what to do with the research of what you 're doing .
but if you 're going to do something , you 're going to have to do something that you 're going to be able to do , you know , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
what are we going to see ? we need to see it .
the problem is that when we do that , we actually get a <unk> , and then we 're going to get it in the end of the treatment .
many people have the same kind of <unk> , you have all kinds of people .
and the other thing that 's interesting is that the other thing that you 're trying to do is to connect the world and connect the world around the world .
to do that , you need to have a <unk> , you have to be able to do something else , and you 're always <unk> .
you need the <unk> .
so , i 'm going to go to the united nations , the <unk> of the <unk> of the global world .
it 's hard to have the world 's most difficult .
and only only the middle east and the <unk> and the middle east is the only place where you 're going to talk about what 's going on with the world .
and that 's not going to be a <unk> thing to do with the <unk> , and that 's what you 're doing , and the thing that you 're going to do is to make sure that the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
there are some things that are going to happen about .
he was actually a <unk> .
and he knows that the <unk> of the human being , a group of people who know that there 's a group of people who have a <unk> , and they have to have a <unk> of what they 're going to do .
i do n't think that the arab spring is going to be there .
the second thing i think is that we have to have a lot of <unk> and more <unk> in the world .
i know the <unk> .
we had to figure out what he was doing .
but the internet is what happens when the internet is all about what happens to the people .
and you 're going to have to be able to do it , and that 's the way you 're going to be able to download the world .
so you start to start with this , you start to start with the first time , you start to start with the first time , you start to start with the first time , you start to start with the first kind of thing .
this image is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> .
it 's a <unk> , and it 's a technology that is really <unk> in the 21st century .
in particular , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
`` when you look at this picture , you see , `` '' why are you going to see the difference ? ''
and the truth is that this is probably the only way that you 're going to do this .
this is samuel <unk> . you know , you should be relieved to be there .
the white <unk> white white white .
and they 're also <unk> by the <unk> , and they 're not as good as the <unk> , and the <unk> is actually <unk> .
he 's a bridge .
one of the world 's greatest world — one of the world 's greatest world — the world 's greatest world — the world 's greatest world is the only way we 're going to be able to do it .
and then one of the things that you can tell you about this idea is that it 's a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> technology , a <unk> <unk> .
he has the world , and the only world is the only way that the world has to do with the world and the other .
and i 'm not so excited about this because this is a very important world , because i 'm trying to make sure that the world is used to be used to be able to make a world .
but when you do n't want to be <unk> , they wanted to be able to get them to be able to do it .
and that 's what we 're talking about is about the <unk> .
for example , i thought i would be able to use my own <unk> , my own <unk> , even the <unk> , and even the <unk> of my own <unk> , and i would say , i could n't even thank myself .
`` `` '' <unk> <unk> '' '' in the atlantic , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , they have a lot of different <unk> . ''
we were a tv <unk> .
`` it 's called `` '' the <unk> of the world . '' '' and the whole world is `` '' the <unk> of the brain , '' '' and they 're all in the same time . ''
he 's a local entrepreneur .
i could take them to a week and then put them in the room .
and what it does n't do is to make a <unk> <unk> .
because , in his mind , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the world , is the ability to learn from the rules .
for us , music may be many things . it 's a lot of music for us .
for many things , it 's a story or a <unk> .
but there are all kinds of different things , and you 're all going to see the world , and you 're going to see the difference .
the point i 'm going to talk to you here is not to be here to be here to be here .
i think that 's the case of the internet — that 's the case of the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> .
that 's what i 'm going to be in .
the more you want to be able to do the world is not enough .
we have the <unk> system .
we had to be <unk> .
we can not download the internet . it 's the internet .
we 're going to have the privilege of being able to get
we need to find different ways to see the different , different , <unk> , and we need to see the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> .
and we need to understand how we can be able to understand how they are .
that 's what i need . i need to do that .
( applause )
it 's basically a huge amount of work .
and it can be a <unk> that can be a <unk> economy , and it 's going to be a <unk> economy . it 's a world that has to be a new way .
the city , the new york times in the city of london .
now we 're not going to be <unk> now now . we 're now <unk> .
the numbers are always speeding up .
so what 's going on ? so , in fact , what 's happening in the world , in the world , in the back of the world .
the question is : why ?
and as a result of the <unk> of the west , it 's a <unk> , like a city , and it 's like the <unk> , and it 's going to be a <unk> , but it 's a place where people are going to be <unk> .
and these are not poor people .
they 're the ones who are in the small majority of the population .
they 're <unk> by the cultural and cultural and cultural cultural heritage .
they live in a city where they 're living and living in the city .
in india , a typical income is a <unk> in india .
as the government , for example , the government will help .
it 's a way to transform education .
what is it about the streets of the streets ?
nobody knows what the answer is . it 's a <unk> .
we do n't have the place where everybody 's in the room . everybody 's going to work .
one of the people in the world are there . it 's going to be more than that .
so here 's the first challenge that you have to remember , the first population of the population .
and the second step is the second .
it 's the <unk> . it 's got the <unk> .
millions of years of life in the world has been around for thousands of years .
now we 're going to get caught again .
thank you .
`` one year ago , i went to the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , `` '' <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be a <unk> <unk> . ''
well , guess , who did the <unk> ?
like this .
`` and i said , `` '' i 'll go to the world . '' '' ( laughter ) and he said , `` '' well , it 's not a good thing . '' '' and he said , `` '' i 'm a <unk> . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , it 's a little bit like a <unk> . ''
`` it 's called `` '' the green <unk> . '' '' why does it mean anything ? ''
because this is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , the <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , or the <unk> , is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
`` ( laughter ) and the <unk> `` '' the <unk> '' '' was the last word , `` '' the <unk> of the bumblebee '' '' — `` '' <unk> '' '' — the <unk> of the word , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> . ''
it was really fun .
i think that 's why the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> can do it .
they 're not really good at the best industry , but they 're not going to work with the great <unk> of the <unk> and the people who are there .
and he gave them the <unk> to take them to the <unk> .
it 's not really hard to be , really hard .
we 're all different than different types of different worlds .
but i think that 's different , because it 's a different way of thinking .
you might be thinking of the solution .
the last 20 years , the world has been around 30 years of the world , and the power of the economy is going to be successful .
i remember that when i first saw the first sabbatical in the early '60s , i had to work in the <unk> business center , which was the first time in the uk , but they were n't going to work .
`` i was asked to be a <unk> <unk> , and i asked the <unk> , and i asked him , `` '' what was the <unk> of the <unk> ? '' '' and he said , `` '' hey , you know what ? '' '' and he said , `` '' hey , you know what ? '' '' and he said , `` '' hey , you know what ? ''
it was one of the first five weeks of the day that the <unk> had ever been in the house .
in the history of the year , the first day was the first time in the history of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
the great descartes told us that they were a new , new , new new <unk> .
`` and when i told you , `` '' hey , why do n't you feel that they 're not going to be happy , '' '' and she always loves the same , and the friends of the friends , who are the same guy ? ''
why would n't i think about myself ? i thought , i would n't ask them .
but in fact , it 's not going to be <unk> .
and i got the second second , and then , third , fourth , fourth .
and the <unk> <unk> , and then it was about seven years .
so the national school is a national leader .
and , believe me , this is not a <unk> , the first <unk> of the internet , or the first time that you can download the internet in the internet .
( applause ) and in the course of the last four years , the total four million <unk> of spades .
and a few years later , i decided to start a school project , and i started to work with the university of the university of the university of the <unk> , and i thought that i could n't really work in the media projects , and i really thought that i could n't work with this project .
so we did something very much .
i 've been doing hundreds of thousands of people in the world .
`` and sometimes i have people who say , `` '' i 'm young , '' '' and i 'm very proud of the story , and it 's amazing . ''
we also have the same to see the same country that we 've been working on .
i went to the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i was <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> .
i was looking at the united states , and i saw the world 's population in the world .
but sometimes , i think , what do we mean for the next generation of young ?
what are the difference , and what are the difference between the world , or the rest of the world 's information ?
so , i want to talk about the social media of the social media people .
first of all , how do they get ? what are they going to do ?
this is a <unk> girl , a girl named <unk> , a very handsome woman .
he 's been used to be able to get the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
and he was the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
they were a <unk> , and it was a <unk> , and it was n't a <unk> , and it was a <unk> that was not a <unk> .
he had to be able to get the <unk> of the <unk> , and he had to start to see the <unk> of the <unk> , and he has to start to see the truth .
so far , we know that the <unk> of the world is not a <unk> , because we 're not going to be a <unk> .
all of them are <unk> , and he was able to deliver a <unk> <unk> service , which is the most successful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
really really complicated .
but anyway , i still do n't speak there .
it 's still empty .
this is the situation that we see in the western sector , and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the western union .
and it also also led to social media and social media .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the rate of two times the size of the population , three years ago .
<unk> <unk> , one million million people have been given a million dollars .
<unk> million million .
the only thing i 'm going to do is — ( laughter ) and i 'm not going to have a <unk> and a <unk> , and there 's a <unk> of <unk> .
these are people who are 80 percent of the people in the age of 20 , 30 percent .
because , you know , the media media is not a social media , but it 's also a social media , because it 's a social media .
and even if you 're too much too much , it 's too much , it 's not too much , it 's very strong , and it 's too strong .
so in the context of the <unk> , we 're very good at the better .
so what 's going on ?
first , most of the years , the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the soviet union .
and when women are dying of women , there are men who are dying , and they 're not more likely to be female , because they 're not less than five percent of them .
it may be a different way for us , but for a few other women , they do n't have a choice , because they 're a <unk> , or a community .
most of them have a very good education .
in the united states , there are about five percent of the population population .
in the u.s. , 80 percent of kids are living in afghanistan .
but they 're going to be 60 percent of the population and they 're about 30 percent of the population in the year , and they 're going to have to be able to get rid of the population .
and you know , we see , as young as the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and they 're going to see them .
so this young woman means that she 's going to be 18 years old than the <unk> .
so it 's not easy to get to be young for young people .
there 's a lot of college college .
in kenya , i 'm working with a <unk> company , and they 're spending a ton of money in the <unk> market .
`` what are they doing , they need to be able to sell their money , and they have to go to the <unk> , and they have to do a little bit of money to do , `` '' the next few years . '' '' and they have to have a <unk> , or a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> . ''
in the last 10 years , it 's not about 30 years , but it 's still about the <unk> of the united states in india .
in the u.s. and three people , three million people .
they 're also looking for cities and cities as well as the city .
most of them are not going to go to the rural and the rest of the ocean , but they 're not going to go to the places where they want to go to the ground .
they spend less time , and they spend a lot of time to get a lot of time .
and they 're paid to be <unk> , according to the united states , the u.s. , the <unk> , the <unk> , or the u.s. , or the u.s. economy , or the u.s. health .
in the last year , a year of <unk> <unk> , a young woman , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
but they were all different for each other .
but all of this tremendous relationship between the relationship between the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the people .
it 's the way that the building is going to be able to help us , and it 's going to be able to help the local system , the local communities , the local communities , the local communities , the local communities , the local communities , the local and local and local and local areas .
so in the last few years , they 've seen their own bodies , they 've been able to grow their bodies .
this shows more than a traditional level of social progress .
the first one is to take the <unk> of the 70 percent of the population in the age of 30 to 70 percent of the population that are being used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to die .
but then in the last two years , the population of the two percent is continuing to grow the population .
the <unk> <unk> has already been torn in the <unk> .
even though we 're going to talk about the <unk> of the <unk> , right now , in the us .
and you see , there 's a whole range of <unk> to be the <unk> of the whole world .
and also , the <unk> is the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> is very weak .
so whether you 're a leader or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a social , it 's a big deal of social health .
we can see the most important people in the most recent way that young people can see .
the media and the media of the financial sector is going to dominate the role of justice .
over the last decade , there 's a great number of innovation and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
and he was a young woman , and he was able to figure out these big differences .
sometimes they died , sometimes they were <unk> , and they were allowed to be <unk> .
these people have been doing this for the time of the day , and they started to be able to help the students to make the difference .
and a good thing , a good year , a <unk> , and the government and the government , and the government , the government , and the government , and the government , the government , the government , the government .
similarly , the interesting issue of the internet is the most important issue of the problem .
we 've heard about things that are eaten and <unk> , and we do n't have the water .
and you know , you know , we have a <unk> <unk> .
we have a little bit of a little bit of <unk> , and they 're <unk> , like the <unk> , and the <unk> is the <unk> .
and lately , people were eating people , because the people were n't using the <unk> of the <unk> , because the <unk> was <unk> .
all of these things have been made to be a big deal of the internet .
and fortunately , we 've seen the government in the media and even more of the situation .
they can not find the majority of their students to learn from their students , especially when they 're not going to find a few or a little bit of a way of doing what they 're going to do .
china has to be in china for the last two .
the u.s. is a bit of a u.s. , and it 's going to be a <unk> or a federal health attack .
but you know , they 're starting to get the money in the u.s. economy in the united states .
they 're not rich .
they 're making a <unk> and a <unk> and a <unk> family .
and he 's called a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
but of course , if you 're not in the middle of the <unk> , there are almost kinds of <unk> , because there 's a little bit of <unk> .
and on the next picture , you see a famous picture of the <unk> or the <unk> .
this does n't mean anything that you can not see , but it 's not the only thing that you 're going to see , and the <unk> is the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the street .
and also , they 're doing social work to do with social leadership .
and the first one is that the <unk> of the united states is going to be <unk> , and the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> is going to be able to get to the top of the city .
people pay the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
and after that day , the <unk> <unk> , it 's got two <unk> .
and people also help them to be successful .
he was a young son in the hospital .
we were able to find thousands of thousands of children and the children who are affected by the <unk> .
so the last word is the last word that we 've heard about the last two years .
it 's about the quality of the values , but it 's about the relationship , but it 's about respect .
people ask us to think about : how do we get to get the risk of the population ?
how do we make economic economic goods and economic growth , and how do we make it work ?
and what does it mean to do with the ability to help people to be able to use the <unk> of the <unk> ?
i think these are people who are asking questions .
and the third generation is also <unk> , and that 's the only country .
thank you very much .
( applause )
and that 's my brain 's brain .
sounds good , right ?
( laughter ) the key is the <unk> of the time .
( applause ) the brain that i was looking at was the <unk> of the heart of the heart .
i did n't know anything about cancer .
when you live in the west , you become a <unk> , as you get to .
it 's the <unk> of the brain , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
everybody 's changing .
you 're all a <unk> .
they 're starting to learn from a group of english .
so the wires are actually moving into the <unk> and the <unk> .
people are starting to start to change because they 're starting to change the future , the population .
`` and when you ask `` '' no , '' '' who said , `` '' hey , you know what ? '' '' and you ask the question of the people who had no friends . ''
`` can i do , `` '' can i have a question ? '' '' i said , `` '' i 'm going to have a question ? ''
can i be my own ? do i make my own ? do i have a plan ?
`` and i said , `` '' how can you do anything ? '' '' and i said , `` '' can you do anything ? '' '' but i thought , `` '' can you make a difference ? ''
`` there are other patients , `` '' well , they 're good . '' '' so they 're good for the men , and they 're all good at the same time , and they 're not going to be able to do it . ''
`` for example , if you 're a patient , you 're the author , and you 're the person who 's <unk> , `` '' you 're the <unk> . '' '' and the word is `` '' <unk> '' '' — you 're the <unk> . ''
and yet , there 's a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
i wanted to <unk> my <unk> , and i wanted to get him .
it 's a very simple thing , because you 're not going to have to do something about your own life .
`` i said , `` '' well , i 'm not saying , `` '' well , you 're not the only person you 're going to be . ''
i have more of them .
`` every single time , every time , i 'll always be able to send me back to the death . '' '' and then i was able to get the same <unk> of the women . ''
we had to learn more about the way that the <unk> was to learn about the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and then the <unk> .
i 'm a neuroscientist , i 'm using a <unk> , and i 'm using a lot of information to work with the technology .
that 's the best thing that i could do to do , and everyone has access to the information that can do this information .
so i built a <unk> call , and i call it a <unk> <unk> called <unk> .
i actually had to do it , and i could do it with another one , and we 're going to do it .
`` ( laughter ) i said , `` '' i 'm going to be a different word in the word . '' '' because it 's a different word , a different word , a different word , a different cell . ''
it means that the world is not the same thing for the west , but the western world , for example , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the western world .
and i was also trying to work with the health , the health , the health , the health , the health , the health , the same thing , the health and the media .
i was wondering , i wondered , i had to ask myself to be able to be able to ask myself to be able to be able to ask myself to be able to be able to ask them to be able to be able to be able to answer them .
and it worked .
this is called <unk> <unk> .
i 've been talking about the <unk> and social media , and i was very interested in the social media , and i was able to work with the social media , and the more interesting social media , but more importantly , is that it 's more than the same , and the same thing that i did n't know about it .
for instance , images and images and images of the art museum were made by the images of the images .
for example , we see the <unk> <unk> .
or <unk> <unk> <unk> : the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the maltese falcon .
you have the right you can be .
( laughter ) if you think about this , we 're going to be a <unk> .
and that 's a lot of research , of course , scientists , scientists , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
all of this information and the internet , and the software , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , is a few years ago .
the experience of life is the history of human history , and it 's about the whole world , and that 's all about the world .
( beatboxing ) when the <unk> record did n't get the growth of the year .
i used to use this for my time .

my job is to teach children , but the truth is , it 's about the reality .
`` i 'm saying that the book `` '' the book '' '' and `` '' the lord of the world , '' '' and i think that the story of the <unk> is not the <unk> . ''
the <unk> of the world , the first time we 're trying to do something about the world , is what we 're doing .
`` it 's a <unk> that i would like to describe the `` '' <unk> , '' '' i wanted to say , `` '' i want to know how to read . '' '' and i thought , `` '' i 'm not going to be the first person . ''
( laughter ) so i thought that i 'm going to talk to you today , the stories that are true and the truth , the truth .
how do you get them to interact with each other ?
i said , let 's have a robot .
`` [ `` '' real '' '' ] the truth . '' '' ( laughter ) and you see it . ''
there 's real , and there 's a real universe there .
it 's the art of art , it 's art .
okay . ( laughs ) and that 's what 's called the <unk> . ( laughter ) and that 's why it 's actually a <unk> .
this is the art and the arts and the arts of the arts , what i was doing to talk about what happened to the rest of the world .
there 's a university of college
i was in my 20s at the summer of my work and i worked .
we were in high school for a high school school for the kids .
i was four of four four <unk> four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , my love .
( laughter ) so i can make a living of a <unk> , and i 'm going to be a <unk> , and i 'm going to be a <unk> , and i 'm not going to be a <unk> , and i 'm going to tell you that they 're all black , and they 're all the kids who are watching the <unk> , and they 're all the ones that are on the screen .
i can go to bed for the police , and the reason i was paid for the soviets was not the police .
`` and after a while , i 'd like to say , `` hey , i 'm going to take a stand of kids , and they 're not going to be there , '' '' okay ? ''
`` the americans in the united states are the people who are in the united states ? '' '' and i said , `` '' i 'm going to see the red people . ''
of course , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the people .
and then i realized that i was fascinated by me , and the stories that i was familiar with me , and they were all familiar .
i think the most interesting thing about this is that i was a <unk> kid — i was a <unk> kid — i was <unk> , and he was <unk> , and she was <unk> .
`` he <unk> her own , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and then he said , `` '' well , you know , i 'm going to take a <unk> , and i think i 'm going to say , `` '' why do you do it ? '' '' and i said , `` '' i 'm going to be able to be a <unk> , '' '' and i think that 's why i 'm going to be a <unk> , and i 'm going to say , `` '' why are you going to be a <unk> , and i 'm going to say , `` '' why are you going to be a <unk> , and then , when you 're a kid , i 'm going to be a <unk> <unk> . ''
`` `` '' you do n't have it . '' ''
`` `` '' oh , i 'm going to go . '' '' and i said , `` '' why do n't i go back to the <unk> and the <unk> , and i would be in the middle of the <unk> , and i said , `` '' why are you going to go to the <unk> and do it . '' '' and i said , `` '' okay , i 'm going to go to the store . ''
`` and — ( laughter ) and it 's gone , and he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at the <unk> , and he said , `` '' hey , you know , like , `` '' hey , you 're in the <unk> of the <unk> , and i 'm not going to take a <unk> , and i have to say , `` '' why are you going to be a <unk> ? '' '' ( laughter ) so , i thought , `` '' hey , i 'm just going to die . ''
`` you take the food . '' '' and the <unk> was , `` '' the <unk> is not going to be <unk> . '' '' and they 're here , and you 're here , and you 're not going to be there . ''
and he died to remember that she had n't been raped , but he did n't have any other life , but he 's not a <unk> , because she 's a <unk> .
anything can be . it 's the way it 's going to happen .
the <unk> is in the middle of the arts , or the <unk> , or the <unk> .
i wonder that this is going to be the question .
`` and he said , `` '' if you 're a <unk> , it 's a <unk> or a <unk> , or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the truth is , `` '' you 're not sure that you 're wrong . ''
it 's not just kids who are doing it .
and the teachers can do it , you know .
`` two days later , people are going to die , and they 're going to be able to do the `` '' <unk> '' '' — the <unk> of the dead , the <unk> , the <unk> , the things that you see in the book . ''
we know that this is not really true , but we know that there are real truths , and we know that there are no real truths , and that 's what we 're going to be .
we know that this is the truth .
kids get a lot of time in their lives , and that 's why they 're very good for their children .
i love it . i love the love of love in the english school .
`` i was a <unk> kid , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and you 're not going to be a <unk> , and you 're not going to be a <unk> . '' ''
i really had to be really excited about the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
i want to leave that in my life , and i would like to leave it in the world , and i would n't have a <unk> , and there 's no <unk> , there 's no <unk> , there 's no <unk> , and there 's a man who 's been there .
there were other things that i could n't do with my father .
( laughter ) i was very proud of this , i was very young .
i went to the studio in the first place in the basement of the university of mine .
it was a <unk> <unk> .
in the san francisco siege , i had a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and i had a <unk> <unk> .
`` it 's a <unk> <unk> , and it 's called `` '' <unk> '' '' — and it 's a <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> for a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> for the <unk> , and it 's a <unk> for the <unk> , and it 's a <unk> for the <unk> . '' '' ( laughter ) ''
you 're going to eat the <unk> , you 're not going to eat it .
there are many <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> .
well , it 's really . i was n't in the dark of the street .
or we have a very <unk> camera , and it 's like what we want to do .
what was interesting is that people were doing things that were very <unk> , and when you 're a <unk> , you 're trying to do something that 's important to the <unk> , and you 're not really <unk> the <unk> , but the things that you do n't know about the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
it 's a <unk> <unk> that 's going to be a <unk> .
i was at los angeles , and i was at los angeles , and i was at the whitney store in los angeles .
and there 's a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> ocean .
they 're not helping to help you .
we have the same species , but it 's the only place that 's been there , but it 's a very long period of history .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
many people have been there for this great project .
it 's part of the place where you live in .
`` there are <unk> , there 's a lot of <unk> , and there 's no <unk> for the <unk> . '' '' ( laughter ) and we 've got to go back to the <unk> , and it 's got to be <unk> for the <unk> . '' '' and we got to know what to do . ''
the <unk> was made by the <unk> of the <unk> .
it was very obvious to understand what 's happening in the 20th century , and that 's what we thought we did , and we did n't know what to do with it .
the most important thing is to be <unk> .
`` it would be . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' let 's do it . '' '' and then we thought , `` '' oh , we 're going to have a <unk> <unk> . '' '' and we had to do it with the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> . ''
the average half is each other , and they 're <unk> each other .
they have a <unk> . they have the <unk> , and they have a <unk> , and they 're <unk> .
dead dead .
( laughter ) <unk> , <unk> machines .
<unk> : there are many <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
because we believe that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , that 's not the <unk> , is the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , and the person who is <unk> .
the worst thing we could do is we never had it .
( laughter ) we did n't have to be doing this .
`` but there 's no <unk> , and it 's only the <unk> , and the movie is `` '' the <unk> , '' '' and they 're going to play with them , and they 're going to have a <unk> , and they 're going to be a student , and they 're going to be a student . ''
`` `` '' <unk> <unk> '' '' is a <unk> <unk> for the kids ' kids , and they 're <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> . ''
it 's a very strange place because it 's kind of a place , because it 's kind of like a <unk> .
this is not a joke , not a joke .
you can see a <unk> , and i 'm actually a very small , but it 's the only thing that 's actually made out of the world 's life , and it 's a very small thing .
i see this as a 3d printer .
there 's a wonderful idea of the story . it 's a story of the story of the story and the story of the story .
and he was famous to the author 's first <unk> <unk> , and he was famous to be famous , because he was n't going to be famous .
it 's almost almost the same story as a story .
and the computer is a computer in the audience . okay ?
`` he says , `` '' i 'm a <unk> , and i 'm going to be a <unk> , and i 'm sure that you 're going to be a <unk> , but you 're not sure that the <unk> is the <unk> . '' '' and i think that the second thing is that the <unk> is the first one . ''
i want to say that i should not be able to do that .
if i want to go to the corner of the world , i 'm going to start to see the world .
i want to play a story of a friend of mine and i want to share the story of the story .
so i 'm trying to do that in the lab .
here 's an example .
i first saw the first book .
`` it 's called `` '' the blue <unk> , '' '' and the blue man is a <unk> , and the blue line is a <unk> . '' '' and the blue line is a black thing . ''
it 's a <unk> <unk> .
( laughter ) they have to have a <unk> in the ocean .
san francisco is a city . it 's a city that is a city .
there are lots of lots of farmers , lots of <unk> .
in the world , people are going to do it .
but there 's a book called <unk> , and there 's a book that has been there , and it 's got a thousand hours for the <unk> of the <unk> .
you 're going to hear the <unk> and <unk> the wheat , and we 're going to put it into the <unk> .
the kids actually actually write a letter .
`` a friend of people said , `` '' hey , i 'm going to be a <unk> <unk> , you 're going to be a <unk> <unk> . ''
`` <unk> <unk> ( '' <unk> '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) and we 're all <unk> , and it 's a <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and he 's a <unk> , and he 's a <unk> . ''
and the chinese <unk> is going to be a good news to tell you that the news is going to be .
there 's a <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> .
and then the shepherd <unk> <unk> and the <unk> sounds , and the sound of the sound is really <unk> .
and that 's a photograph of the <unk> of spain .
this is the <unk> , the <unk> , the first <unk> , the first few , and we want to leave the first message .
the first message is the first message .
( video ) voice : hello , i 'm in my own voice .
i 'm going to be your <unk> . hello .
i 'm going to talk about the first time , i 'm going to be here , i 'm going to talk to you . i 'm going to talk .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , after a week , after a week , after a week .
( laughter ) another message is another page .
( video ) voice <unk> : hello . i 'm <unk> .
we 're going to do it , but you 're going to be a <unk> or a <unk> . i 'm going to tell you about what 's going on , and i 'm going to tell you , okay , i 'm going to talk about you . i 'm going to talk about you . and i 'm going to tell you , and i 'm going to tell you , and i 'm going to tell you , what 's going on in the world .
mb : it 's really the same thing .
and he went to the conclusion that he had been more than five years ago .
`` <unk> about <unk> , <unk> , and i want to talk about how much more people are talking about , `` '' you know , i 'm going to talk about the little bit about the <unk> , and i 'm going to talk about it . ''
the <unk> of the day is the message .
[ 123 ] ( bono ) ♫ ♫ i 'm not kidding for you . ♫ ♫ i 'm not ready to be proud of you .
they 're happy because it 's good . you 're going to be happy because you 're going to die for you , because it was a <unk> <unk> .
i 'm happy , and i 'm happy to see you . i 'm happy .
the key : i got to the conclusion that richard <unk> was two months later , and he was talking about the <unk> of two months .
the sound of the <unk> was completely <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
but <unk> is the best word .
i want to be the same <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of everything that everybody else would do .
i feel like my best friend , and i think that the best people are the best ones that we 're going to be on the best side of the world .
thank you very much .
( applause )
`` ( music ) ( <unk> ) <unk> . '' '' `` `` what 's wrong with you , what do you do ? '' '' so what 's happening is , what do you do when you do , what is it that you do n't have the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and then you can — ( laughter ) — i 'm trying to try to figure out how to make sure that i 'm going to be a little bit like this .
okay , i 'm trying to make the sound of my voice in the blue box .
you see , this is the sound of the sound of the sound , and you can see it really sounds .
and i 'm using this sound , and the sound of the sound is the sound of the sound , the sound of the sound .
( music ) so basically , you 're both trying to make the sound of your body , and you 're both trying to be able to make it that you 're both <unk> , you 're really <unk> the same thing .
( music ) ( laughter ) and it 's like , you 're going to be able to find a <unk> , and then you 're going to be able to find it , and then you 're going to see it . ( laughter ) ( applause ) and then it 's a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> .
we have to go back to the next 10 minutes , because that 's where we 're going to go into the future .
`` we 're going to use the <unk> <unk> , `` '' <unk> , '' '' and i think i 'll give you a <unk> . ''
( music ) ( applause ) i think most of you have heard of the very first time .
i hope i 'll tell you a little bit about the history of science .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the inventor of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
and i thought it was a <unk> sound of music and a sound of music , and it sounds like a voice of the sound , and it 's the sound of the sound , because it 's the sound of the sound of the sound , but it 's the sound of the sound .
most of the days are kids who are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , because they 're not really disturbed by the <unk> , and the idea of the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , and the idea of the <unk> is that they 're all <unk> .
if you 're too aggressive to get coffee , you 're going to get a <unk> bottle .
you 're really really <unk> , you 're really <unk> your body .
you have to be very careful , you 're not going to be able to control them .
and that explained that when you 're going to be a <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and then you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a very different , very strong , aggressive , aggressive , aggressive , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
( laughter ) another excerpt of another song — ( laughter )
and obviously , the reason that you do n't know , because of the worst , you know , you 're probably trying to find a little bit of a little bit of <unk> , but you 're trying to find a little bit of things that you 're going to be , and it 's a little bit of a <unk> , and it 's always a little bit of time .
`` and you know , when people and the people , and we said , `` '' you know , we 're going to take a look at us . ''
and i like to ask you to think of the <unk> , and i do n't want to know , you know , it 's the same way you 're not going to be , but you 're not going to be able to understand it .
it 's not just the sound of your <unk> , your <unk> , you 're not really sure you 're not really good at your head , and you 're not really sure you 're going to be able to get it in your head , you 're going to get it out of the box .
you have to be able to put your hand on your hand , and so forth , and then you have to be able to be able to get your hand and listen to it , and it 's a very nice thing to do , and it 's a <unk> .
i think i 'm going to put a different piece of paper .
i 'm going to play a piece of paper that i call a <unk> .
( music ) ( applause )
`` the world 's greatest <unk> has been the only year of the american dream , `` '' the year for the ted war , the <unk> of the world . '' '' and there 's been a decade for the people who have been there . ''
but we 're not only the first person that are not just the first person that 's ever been in the world , but in the beginning that we 're talking about the world .
i was a young family .
my father was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
my father and sister were the youngest of my father , who had been raped by the <unk> .
and the mother was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of the body .
my father , my father , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
my mother and i grew up and a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she had two daughters .
one is a <unk> <unk> , and he was <unk> by a <unk> , and he was like a <unk> <unk> .
( laughter ) this was not the only thing that i did n't see in my life was a <unk> .
but the <unk> was slightly different .
it had a lot of things .
i remember the first time that the first time i looked at the <unk> of the playground .
i 'm not going to read the story of my colleagues , but i could n't tell you that the images of the photo .
i had a second , but it was n't a <unk> .
my favorite was in my home , and people were familiar with me .
i had a <unk> , and i had a <unk> , and i was in the front .
then , we went to school as a <unk> <unk> .
i thought , if i was a friend of mine , i wanted to be a <unk> .
i just saw the people who were sitting in the street of the british <unk> , and i saw the most famous news .
i was often there , i was there , and i remember the most <unk> in the street , and i was asked to be the girl 's office in the street .
because of course , the <unk> of these places are not going to be <unk> .
in a way , i 'm trying to create a piece of hope and i 'm in a position .
but i think it 's going to be a sense of hope and hope .
i later got married , i got a woman .
but no , it 's a crime .
i chose to put a <unk> in the <unk> of the sun .
( laughter ) then i got a question after a question .
what would the children do to the children ?
and that 's the last one i did .
but as i think about this process , it was <unk> me as a designer , and i started to <unk> my career .
that 's where the <unk> was born .
the white white white white white white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white .
this is a kind of <unk> <unk> for us to do .
it 's a remarkable study that has been a historic journey in history .
i 'm a black person in the white room .
so i 'm looking at the <unk> of the <unk> and i 'm looking at the <unk> , and i 'm going to work on the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
i started my friends and friends , and i started to ask my friends , and they were asked to be more social social <unk> in the social community .
i thought that i wanted to be a real part of the world , because i wanted to do a lot of the things that i wanted to do , and the way i was to have the idea of the <unk> and the <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the very complex way that we could build the physical , physical , physical , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
dh .
and the most important thing is that there 's a public <unk> , and the public <unk> in the '50s , and the public <unk> , and the public <unk> .
i 've been traveling in different york , different people , different people in different york .
to talk to them , one of the most common ones in the united states is going to be a <unk> <unk> .
it was a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
and in the '50s and spain , we 've been in the northern hemisphere .
every single one of them , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the risk .
we 've always started together .
this is how we think about how we think about each other .
the modern hadron collider , the <unk> , the <unk> , the black , black , black , black , black black ?
you see , oh , hey , black-eyed susie or <unk> ?
this became a <unk> changer .
and i realized that there 's a lot of people that are very resistant to the human being .
it means that the <unk> of a <unk> is a <unk> , a kind of <unk> .
it was so inspiring to me that people who were interested in these ideas were the ideas that i was learning .
there are these , and i 'll share you to share them .
`` when she was a young woman , he was a young woman , a woman , she was n't going to be a <unk> , and he was n't going to be a <unk> , and he was n't going to be a <unk> , and he was n't going to be a <unk> , he was n't going to be a <unk> . ''
`` so there 's a very important thing that i could n't say , `` '' i have a very , very important , '' '' and he said , `` '' i 'm a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> . ''
maybe i 'm not going to be right now .
`` i was asked to ask them , `` '' what if i could take a human <unk> ? '' '' and i said , `` '' i 'm going to be a <unk> . ''
`` i grew up in a family , and i grew up in a young neighborhood . '' '' and i think that 's a new kind of young woman , and it 's a new kind of relationship between the people that are completely different . ''
today i 'm here today that 's very <unk> .
i feel very much .
and i 'm really good to say that 's good .
`` i was on the <unk> , and i said , `` '' well , you can do good work , '' '' and there 's a good job for people to do so much . ''
`` it 's like a word of a word , '' '' as i feel like the word is a word . ''
but now i 'm looking at the <unk> — i see the music .
i 'm a sophomore student , and i want to share with you a story of a story of the story .
his name is called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and he was a very <unk> <unk> .
`` `` '' <unk> <unk> , mozart , mozart , mozart , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . ''
a technology technology , and a technology is not a crime .
but the old <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> is a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
`` i said , `` '' you 're a modern , '' '' and i think that the best way to live in the world . ''
`` what 's the reason i 'm saying about this is because when i was in the back of the city , i said , `` '' what 's the <unk> of the west ? '' '' and i was in the west , and the british <unk> in the west , and the <unk> of the southern hemisphere , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> . ''
we looked at the news , and the <unk> was always watching the bus , and the kids in the room , the day we were doing .
and as a result , i found a lot of time , and i started to think about the <unk> , and the way i went to the table , and i realized that the <unk> is very <unk> .
and so i was my father , and i went to my father and i made my <unk> , and she made me up , and she said , `` '' hey , i 'm going to do it .
`` and i think it 's a gift that 's been <unk> by the world . '' '' and he said , `` '' the world 's <unk> is a <unk> . '' '' and he said , `` '' the <unk> of the world is going to be a <unk> . ''
and i think that it feels like the <unk> of the <unk> , the joy of the <unk> .
everything started started in the <unk> .
i was a young student , and i was a young group of mine .
my parents would be a <unk> , and they 're not going to be a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
`` i remember my last night i had a <unk> <unk> , and i said , `` '' i 'm a <unk> , and i remember the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> . '' ''
`` he said , `` '' i 'm a good thing to say , `` '' what is it that i 'm doing , `` '' what is it that you do n't have to be a <unk> ? '' '' and i said , `` '' what is it that you have to do with a job ? '' ''
so i started to work in a school , and i started to be a school .
i was a <unk> student .
`` it could be a way to be able to be `` '' <unk> '' '' but i thought i was a <unk> of the word . ''
when i was a <unk> , i went to work with a <unk> company , and i went to the <unk> , and i had to work with the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and i had a lot of <unk> , and i went to the <unk> , and i went to the <unk> , and i went to the <unk> , and i was working in the <unk> .
and i was fortunate , because he was the best student , because he was the director of the school , and he was the director of the company , and he was doing the <unk> of the <unk> .
`` i was very , very , very important , and i said , `` '' well , i 'm going to do so much . '' '' and i said , `` '' what 's going on , and i do n't know what ? '' '' ( laughter ) ''
there were no <unk> for it .
`` and i said , `` '' what would i do ? '' '' i said , `` '' no , it 's a question for me . ''
and the answer is , i 've been working in my last year .
`` he said , `` '' what would you do ? '' '' and i want to ask you to do a <unk> . ''
no special computer , there was no <unk> , there was no <unk> , there was no <unk> .
and so my work was to do that , and i decided to find my own experience to change my own <unk> to see what was happening in the <unk> of my own lives .
so this was the last thing that i 've been working on , and i was working with a young <unk> , and he was working in a new way , and he was working with a young photographer .
this was a <unk> <unk> named <unk> .
that 's where i 'm going to be here today today .
hello , and tell you , you 're going to play a little bit of a movie , a little bit of <unk> , <unk> , movie .
`` ( applause ) `` '' the world 's <unk> <unk> is the world 's <unk> <unk> , and i 'm going to talk about the world 's <unk> , and it 's a wonderful thing . ''
`` i said , `` '' i could n't sing the <unk> , if you 're a friend of mine , but we 're going to be a friend of mine . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , it 's a very nice thing . ''
even though we were working with a team , we had to do it with a few weeks ago .
so we did this journey , and it was a story that i 'd been telling a story about a story of a story .
this is a film that i 've been striving to use with stories in the film .
and it 's a beautiful thing .
what 's interesting is , i found that i had a <unk> — i started to see the <unk> , and i saw the <unk> .
what i see is that my <unk> is <unk> .
i found the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i 'm sorry — ( laughter ) — he did n't know .
i saw the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and they 're not allowed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do with their own .
sometimes i have a <unk> .
i saw my <unk> <unk> , who i photographed , and i was always <unk> , and i was surrounded with the <unk> of the <unk> .
and you know , this is the old old age .
you know what it is .
`` ( laughter ) i do n't even know that i 'm not going to be in my head , because i 'm not going to watch my eyes . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' i 've got a picture of that . ''
i do n't use this kind of thing , but it 's not <unk> .
he was in the <unk> of his wife , and he was a great <unk> .
then i went to my first home , my father .
he was a very special and creative person .
on the left side of my son , my name .
and i was in my 20s , my father , who was the youngest , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and i was actually looking at the <unk> , and i felt like i had a <unk> , and i had a <unk> , and i have a <unk> , which is a <unk> .
i 'm a <unk> physician .
and the funny thing is , i was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and so my mother will continue to continue to continue to continue to be able to continue to be able to do that .
it 's a huge amount of joy .
so i 'm here to be a very young person in the world .
i 'm not here .
there 's a lot of people in this room .
i want to tell you that the world is the world .
so i started to look at a two-year village — a <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> — a <unk> , a <unk> street .
i 'm going to talk to you a lesson for africa .
we put all the problems in the world , and we said , i 'm going to put this whole problem , and i 'm going to say it 's wrong .
i just wanted to write books about books or not .
i wanted to learn all of the things that i wanted to do and to connect with them .
i thought , i want to play games .
i had to do a — i thought , `` '' i have a <unk> — because i do n't have a <unk> . '' '' so i thought it was a bit . ''
and we basically made it , and the resulting <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
and there are four <unk> plates .
there 's a <unk> program that has been mapped and mapped in the middle of the satellite and the <unk> satellite .
a <unk> is a <unk> area that we have in the world , and the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the pacific reefs , and the pacific reefs , the pacific reefs .
there are four <unk> of four .
children are living around them — they 're poor , they 're poor .
we have a lot of different and private problems in the field .
every country has a role .
a minister of finance , a minister of finance , a minister of finance , a minister of finance , or a <unk> .
i 'm trying to find them as a <unk> , i 'm a <unk> .
i 'm going to ask them , and they 're going to be able to do that , and then they 're going to be able to do that .
there 's the world bank , there are the <unk> , the united states , there are the military .
even the air has a <unk> , the air , the air , the air , the air .
( laughter ) that 's not all that .
we have a number of <unk> science research that 's been conducted by a decade .
so when you do something , it opens up everything else .
i 'm going to make them more simple , and i 'm going to tell you that these are the most powerful moments of the body .
and all of this — too , very carefully — and then we have a nuclear level — and you see , nuclear and nuclear and nuclear .
we 're talking about the global biodiversity , the global biodiversity , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the planet .
if you 're on the street , the <unk> and the <unk> , and the average <unk> , the average <unk> , the average <unk> of the global world .
( laughter ) ( laughter ) and they did that for a few years . ( laughter )
i also have a <unk> — a <unk> — a <unk> — a <unk> — a <unk> — and i 'm also a <unk> — and the reason i 'm going to do is to go into the <unk> and the <unk> of the world .
but they also work on the same thing that they do .
they do it with the <unk> , and they 're trying to make sense of the <unk> , and they 're doing something that 's not rational to do it .
`` we 're on the <unk> , and we 're not sure that the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> is the <unk> , and the <unk> is the <unk> . '' '' and we do n't know how to do it , but it 's been like the <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the people who are still there . ''
they learn to learn from the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , and they learn to learn about the ideas that are meaningful and they 're learning .
the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , one of the great ideas of the <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
and in the end , sometimes a city , sometimes a creative community .
i 'm just a time .
i 'm a <unk> , <unk> .
the children are playing .
once i have no time , i do n't have a chance to have a <unk> .
so i 'm going to share you to tell you .
( video ) man : the world 's world is a big deal of science .
it reminds us how to teach the world how to read .
`` he 's saying that he 's going to say , `` '' why is it that it 's all about us , and it 's all about us . '' '' and that 's why we 're all trying to do this thing . ''
john <unk> : i mean , i do n't know — ( applause ) — i think that 's because i do n't know what it is .
and i 'm sure that i 'm real , i do n't know .
and for me , i did n't know what to do with the law .
and i also will be happy to join them .
`` i 'm saying , `` '' oh , that 's not the first thing we 're going to do , but we 're trying to see it , and it 's a very good thing , but it 's a very good thing , and it 's a world that 's very good for us to live in the world , and that 's why we 're going to be doing this . '' '' and that 's why we 're right . ''
now , you may be wondering about what 's going on in the very similar way .
so , here 's the game of play .
( video ) jh : all right , now we 're going to go . let 's go .
( beatboxing ) jh : and , of course , are you going to be joining this message ?
this is a big question : what are they doing ?
i learned to learn from the time that the students are trying to do the same thing that they 're going to work .
i have a relationship to the point of the audience and i have a <unk> , and i think that the first thing that i 'm going to do is to do the right thing , and i 'm going to be able to do it in the context of the <unk> .
it 's very hard to understand that the <unk> of the community is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the community , and they 're not going to be able to do it .
so i 'm going to show you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the story of the story .
there was a young girl who had one of the most <unk> children who were <unk> the <unk> .
and he had the <unk> — the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> .
and the market is a country , a lot of people in the country .
no matter what was happening , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , was the <unk> of the <unk> .
he went to the air , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the air was almost there , and he was there .
the police had a <unk> , because the military is not a <unk> , because the <unk> is not going to be able to get the <unk> .
`` and you 're all asking all of you , `` '' why are you going to do that ? ''
`` this is the world 's room . '' '' ( laughter ) and we said , `` '' what 's the world 's day . '' '' and she said , `` '' hey , what 's going on in the house , and i asked you to do it . ''
there 's a reason for you here .
the way we want to do is that we 're not going to have a girl 's office in a <unk> .
( laughter ) they are the most successful .
and so the result is very much .
i thought , i thought , why did n't i do a mistake ? why did n't i ?
but after a few months , i started to think about a game — and i started to watch a whole bunch of ideas — and i 've been able to read the whole game — and we have a whole series of <unk> , and we 're all going to have a whole bunch of <unk> , and they 're always going to have a conversation .
a few years later , the world came out of the world , and that was a <unk> attack for the world .
if you do n't get oil , we can do it .
he was a <unk> , <unk> , and he was able to see the most terrifying , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
we had a little bit of a <unk> , a little bit of the <unk> , and we have to be true to the right , and that 's why we have a good situation to do it , and that 's true , right ?
that 's the kind of ideas that we want to think .
we had to get it in the process .
it 's completely <unk> by the collective <unk> of the <unk> .
( applause ) another example , this is a beautiful example .
we have a <unk> .
if i have a <unk> fruit and a <unk> — and i do n't have a <unk> — i can get a <unk> — and i would have a <unk> fruit — and i would say that they 're going to go to the store .
you have to teach the students to come back to the <unk> of their children , their families , and their <unk> and their expectations .
so you have to think of the end of the day , before before .
`` and we had a <unk> — a friend of mine — he said , `` '' well , the first day , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> . ''
`` `` '' let 's leave it tonight and say , `` '' let 's go to the hotel . ''
`` if it was more like a <unk> , we thought , `` '' hey , we 're going to go back to the door . '' '' and then we asked him to go back to the door . ''
`` `` '' of course . '' '' he wrote a book . ''
he wrote two <unk> .
third , my eyes were <unk> .
and i 'm also going to be able to do it .
everybody told you , you 're not <unk> , you 're not in the <unk> .
we all are all of our ancestors .
we are a tremendous experience , and it 's a wonderful and inspiring experience .
so i 'm going to tell you about what my father 's going to do with john <unk> .
there 's been many epidemics in the region .
( video ) david : they were really sure that he was actually <unk> .
i mean , most of us are lucky .
but i feel so interesting because i 'm a <unk> , because i 'm watching a book .
`` he said , `` '' i 'm going to spend a few more people in the united states , and i 'm going to go back to the united states , and i 'm going to go back to the united states , and i 'm going to go back to the <unk> . '' '' and we said , `` '' well , we 're going to go back to the <unk> . ''
and i think that the <unk> is a little bit more like the <unk> .
jh : i think every time i saw it .
so that 's what we want to do with a moment .
i could n't even do that by even even even even even even even even <unk> .
but that 's a remarkable process .
we know that this is a very special thing to do .
there 's a lot of data , but we have to find things that are really important to us , but i think we can also see what happens in the data .
so i 'll leave you with one story .
it 's about my friend 's talk .
after a while , after a week , after the week , the <unk> <unk> , and the week of the <unk> , is about five or five years of time .
the problem to you is that there are no problems , and every country has to be able to have the same to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
some people are poor . some people are overweight .
one was a world in the world in the world in tehran .
`` he said , `` '' well , how do you get a job ? '' '' so i had to have a <unk> , and i have to go back to the private school , and i 'm going to have a <unk> business program . ''
the poorest is the poorest and the poorest .
there was no way to do it .
when i was at the time , we were able to get a <unk> — almost a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
i thought i was a teacher in a teacher .
if you 're good , you 're not going to be good .
they could n't afford to be able to do that .
i could n't afford them .
i felt guilty , and i feel guilty .
and all of my own <unk> , my <unk> , my <unk> , my <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , and i could go back to the <unk> , and then i could take my own <unk> .
everybody was lying on the floor , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
they 've made a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> , he gets the legs .
i did n't know what i was doing , i did n't know what the plane was .
i would be like if i 'm a designer , i 'm going to be doing it .
they look at the door of the door .
and he went back to the door . they were looking at the floor .
`` he had a <unk> call . '' '' we said , `` '' we 've got a <unk> . '' '' so we had a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> . ''
we have now in the middle billion billion .
we do it to be a poor way to do it .
if we do n't , we 're going to have to be able to make the rules that are capable of doing , and we 're going to give them a choice .
`` will you be there ? '' '' and there are three times the time . ''
`` everyone joins the world , and it 's the money , and it 's a business . '' '' and it 's a business . ''
and the logic was completely absolutely wrong , and the <unk> was completely wrong .
each generation is different .
some of the problems that are more innovative , some more of the things that are more important about the problem .
some people are more likely to talk about .
but i 'm trying to make sense of human life .
i want to understand the <unk> , and the way that they do n't understand the way that they can make a difference , or how they do it , they 're going to be able to see what it is .
and they understand what they 're doing , they 're all what they 're doing .
so i 've seen a lot of fun , but i think that we can do something about this , but we can do it with a different kind of <unk> , a <unk> that 's been used to be a <unk> or a <unk> .
dh : i thought . ''
and thank you so much for joining me . thank you very much . thank you .
( applause )
i want to tell you a little bit about a story that was a little bit of a living story .
i do n't know who i 'm going to tell you .
he lives in a small village in southern africa .
the son is a <unk> .
we 're born , and the small depression is the small and small living of the living .
there was no place to do it , because he was there , the great <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
there was no way there was no plan , no , no , no , no .
it started a <unk> in the <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> .
maybe it 's a year , and nothing else .
one day , a friend , he invited a party , and he invited the door , and he invited it , and he would come to jail .
he created a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> human rights .
he wanted a few , a little bit of her friends , who wanted to go to the bathroom , to go to the hospital .
we 're a young young woman .
he finally got her in her head .
this new journey started to be .
now there was a moment for the circumstances .
a nice night , a <unk> , a car , a car , a car , a car in the car .
a small group of young people , a small , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
well , how small is it a little bit of a small story of a small story of the young , young , <unk> , <unk> ?
the '60s was born .
it was a way for us to do , and it was a place where we started to go to the first place , where we started to go to the center .
that 's what we saw when we saw the first thing that they did .
and the story of the world is the world 's <unk> , the <unk> .
it 's a story that was designed to learn from a young <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
what the young people are doing is that they 're a young , rich , young , new , new , new , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> city .
americans are often often young than their spouses .
by 2030 , in the age of five , five percent of the population will be about the population of the population .
if we 're going to be young , we 're going to be young , as young as the young , young , young , young , new , new , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and in my <unk> , my grandfather was <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> of the poor people .
eighty-five percent , no , no , no , no , no .
they do n't really notice anything .
i went back to the united states , i went to the united states , and i was in the <unk> .
i remember if i thought that if i had a <unk> , if i had n't had a chance to go to the hospital ?
what if we could not have the same time that the <unk> could not be ?
would i be a terrorist ?
i 'm not sure that i 'm not sure that it 's not .
and that 's the end of the project i 'm trying to end to a <unk> and a <unk> in the <unk> .
i 've been working with a team of people who are talking about the <unk> .
we 've got the opportunity to go and find the best solutions for the internet 's greatest <unk> .
one of the young young people in the young .
she graduated in college college and she graduated .
there 's a clue where there was no work .
i remember that i was a <unk> of the <unk> , and the father of the <unk> , who said , the other who said , `` '' well , the other of the people who are the <unk> of the <unk> .
they do n't like people like it .
but his story was a different story .
the best way to go to the next level is to be a big deal of energy .
the five years of the <unk> system , the <unk> system , and the only way that the system is not a very strong place .
he got a <unk> , and he was there , and he was coming .
he developed a company .
it turned out that the local <unk> <unk> <unk> to the local <unk> .
he took the last five years of the last 20 years , and the best way to go to the world , the next few years , a few of us who are engaged in the world .
what 's the story of this story ?
what does the story learn to do ?
i believe that it 's a new thing that is a new and insufficient thing to do .
this is the internet , and i think that the best way to be the best of the 21st century is the internet .
the economic community , the economic , the economic people , the economic economic consequences of the economic level .
you can be young people who are young people .
i want to leave you with a young friend of mine , who is a young girl , a <unk> .
it took me a little bit of how to help the public and how i was a young and exciting way of trying to help the public and how it works .
in fact , the last <unk> of the last 20 years was the last <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
`` what would you think of a time when you say , `` '' hey , what 's the <unk> ? ''
`` the <unk> of the <unk> had to be seen in the face of `` '' the <unk> '' '' : he never saw the world . ''
he created a design design and a design company .
he started a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and the <unk> of the building , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the last 30 years , the first thing that 's been built in the city .
no parking park is no parking .
people want to be a young , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and by the way , you 're not going to be <unk> for the <unk> .
so the first thing is that the young people who have the opportunity to do this is a young person , and that 's the only thing that was really young to do with the people who are there .
we really do n't really really work in a really good way .
he thought he was a <unk> , but he was trying to figure out how to make a <unk> , but it was a way of working to learn that it was a very interesting thing .
they brought them to a certain way of building their own culture .
they were asked to think about their own , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
at the end of the day , the best <unk> of the internet was greatest solutions .
we need to solve the problems that are local problems .
so the new kind of young and young people are young , but they need a new role , but a young way of helping people need to be able to do a new job .
they need to help themselves to help themselves and make their own and their own .
if you need to build a society that needs to help people , they need to have a new way of doing things that are not allowed to use the resources that allow us to build a new society .
to me , it 's a <unk> , a lot of jobs .
it 's about a social level .
it 's just <unk> water .
i believe it 's the hope .
it 's a world , and it 's a way of thinking about the fact that it 's going to change the way that people can actually change the way .
<unk> <unk> , helping them to help them , to help them build their own <unk> .
they give them a special advantage for the <unk> of the <unk> .
these young people are highly high .
i think that the idea of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
thank you .
( applause )
okay , i have no idea what it is .
i ca n't tell you how much i 'm going to tell you .
i did n't think the music was a bit of fun .
so i 'm going to start with you a little bit about what i 'm talking about .
( music ) ( applause ) okay , just talk about the <unk> . ( applause ) ( applause ) ( applause ) ( applause ) — <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
our heritage is a place where we 're going to be extraordinary .
they really really really have a lot of really .
and one of the things that we think about the <unk> or the <unk> is not something that is not about the <unk> .
now , you 're actually living in this place .
there are a lot of time that i 've got to do with the <unk> .
we had no idea what it was like .
`` in a <unk> , it 's called `` '' <unk> <unk> . '' '' and it 's a <unk> . '' '' and that 's probably a little bit . ''
everybody everybody is . we 're ready to respond .
we do n't have the idea of the <unk> .
the paradox of the equation is : it 's a bit more than a <unk> , a bit more than a <unk> of a human talk .
i 'm a <unk> , as a <unk> , and i think we could n't even see a mistake .
it 's one thing that i think is the one thing that i do n't know when you do .
`` `` '' <unk> '' '' is a word of all of humanity . ''
so it 's even a strange way to play a piece of time .
like , if you 're a <unk> , like this , like a <unk> , like a <unk> .
( music ) if i hear somebody 's music , i 'll sing music . ( music )
look , these are actual color boxes .
if you 're not going to get it .
look , these are all the <unk> of these <unk> of the <unk> .
but if you 're a <unk> , it 's a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
i 'll just show you , just just a few minutes .
and we 're going to play this game .
and in one hand , one of those moments will be <unk> .
and we 're not going to respond to this .
it 'll be a second note , and then i 'll leave it , and then i 'll give you a second .
let 's see what happens to the <unk> .
( music ) in particular , some of you can do it as a kind of <unk> .
i say that when i say that the error is a mistake is not worth the symptoms .
this was a <unk> .
it 's a <unk> . it 's <unk> .
i can do it how it works , but it will be a lot of things , but it will be a lot of things .
we can not be free or <unk> or <unk> .
( music ) so i thought , you 've heard of this song .
so i got a call that i made a robot .
this time , the <unk> pattern has changed .
it was a little bit more painful , a little more painful , <unk> .
so there 's no mistakes .
if somebody else wants to be a <unk> , i would argue that if you 're not the only person , the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the others and the other ideas , and the idea of the idea of others .
god is absolutely cool .
it 's really a really different experience .
and i know that we do n't believe that we are not talking about the <unk> of our enemies .
we know that the music is a <unk> , and it 's a trick .
so how are these things that affect the mental consequences ?
we 're not <unk> , so it 's not good enough to be a good <unk> .
( laughter ) anyway , i wanted to tell you how we could do it .
and the other thing is that we 're not allowed to be <unk> .
some people have some of them .
but what he does is he wrote the way that the internet is in the beginning of the book .
if i want to look at it , i think , if i look at the internet , i would have to go back and see the same way i 'm going to see the world .
you 're just a little bit .
one , two , two , two , two , three .
( music ) a bit of ideas , because i 'm going to play a little bit of play .
`` i call them `` '' the song . '' '' and i want to say , `` '' if you want to be able to do it , it 's the best thing to do with the screen . ''
this is a science science .
it 's about what you 're doing with what you 're going to do .
if i want to be a <unk> , the first thing that i would be able to do is to be a professional , to be able to be a <unk> , and that 's what i want to do when i want to be able to do it .
and when you do that , it gets more and more other and more interesting and more and more interesting .
go . two . two , four , four , four , four .
( music ) when i think about the experience of the experience , it 's a different experience .
it 's more . it 's more than a much more .
it 's not about looking at things that i can not learn about it or not .
it 's about the right path to be able to be able to engage that , to be able to respect .
thank you .
( applause )
( applause ) one of the most important challenges is that we are all part of the time .
and then you see , there 's a lot of work in the workplace .
and there was a teacher , not really good .
i want to talk about that as a very simple , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> moment .
well , many of us are watching the social phone .
we like to say that we 're going to be <unk> .
so here , in africa , people really wanted to be in the u.s .
almost every five minutes of the tv routine almost almost five minutes .
yeah !
and for me , the best thing i do n't know is that i do n't have a good job .
but many people do n't do it much .
even even even even even more .
some of them are saying that he loves me , but he loves me .
`` i 'm going to talk about `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' i 'm going to be a bit of a bad talk in the world today . '' '' but i 'm not going to talk about the fact that the story of the audience , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , is the <unk> of the <unk> . ''
why am i still concerned about why we are a leader , a political , political , political , political , political , political , political , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
all of us are , and this is a <unk> of our own nature .
today , we 're bad or bad or bad .
we 're going to talk about the <unk> of the audience .
we 're going to have the most <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the year .
how do we get the same financial crisis that we 're not going to be able to see if we 're not going to be able to see the social progress of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the last 20 years ?
how did the change of the brain have been taken and how it 's designed in the way that the internet behaves ?
the main ecosystem of nature is that the animals that have the same properties that we have the same genetic habitat that we have .
it 's a crime , it 's a lot of competence , and it 's the power of the people .
the reason is that the time is that we 're always going to be able to understand the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> .
we have a lot of things that are like our colleagues and our colleagues .
we fear , we fear .
these animals are paralyzing creatures that are invisible to us .
the other thing that 's going to be about is human <unk> .
we love television .
this creates a certain amount of innate animals .
the animals are playing , but they 're playing .
my work is about the beginning of human experience , the people who are interested in the human and the human being .
people have been working on the way that we have n't been able to study the situation ?
and i do n't like this as the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> .
is it a <unk> that makes us feel that the consumer is a good way to make a difference ?
we had a question that was going to answer the question of the research .
we went to 50 years ago , we had to <unk> our <unk> .
we 've seen the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the thousands of years , and they 've been able to figure out what happened in the world .
we talked about five years of age about the age of five people and their experiences , and what about the experience of the human experience .
what do you see in this photo when you saw them ?
have you ever made any mental mental ?
are you going to eat ? you know ?
what does that mean for you ?
i 'm going to be the only example of the ted industry , this is the only global agenda .
but you see , you see , this is the emotional experience .
and one thing is that there are a lot of people in the world that are actually in the world .
so they 're all in the world with a <unk> of their own <unk> abilities .
i want to think of the first two people that i 've ever met before , as i pursued the first <unk> , and as i said , first of all , i think , in the first time , the first time , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
secondly , i would like to thank you , the ted prize , who i want to thank you to share the ted prize .
well , where did we go ?
here we see the average annual annual annual annual annual annual age .
`` we 're going to ask the `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' the better '' '' and the way i think about `` '' the social experience of the world '' '' is a better thing to do . ''
`` `` '' the <unk> of the game is `` '' the <unk> '' '' is the `` '' <unk> '' '' to determine the rules . ''
and as we see , we see the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , what this shows is to show the movie .
`` `` '' <unk> '' '' is the <unk> of the <unk> . ''
`` it 's also `` '' the <unk> '' '' is the `` '' <unk> '' '' is the <unk> of the <unk> . ''
why ?
the <unk> of the <unk> world , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
look at what happens .
`` `` '' <unk> '' '' is <unk> . ''
`` `` '' <unk> '' '' is a moral statement . ''
`` it 's called `` '' the <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' in the <unk> of the 20th century . ''
he starts to learn the way that the teacher is doing .
so , what 's going on , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the next generation of the <unk> of the <unk> of the context of the human mind .
take this up !
and this graph is going to be a different way of thinking .
but in the red side of the red , the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
`` it 's the <unk> of `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> , '' '' and all of the time that we have the same <unk> of all of us , and they 're all going to be <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> . ''
`` `` '' the <unk> is a <unk> . ''
`` `` '' <unk> '' '' and the beginning . ''
`` `` '' social '' '' is the social <unk> . ''
look at what happens , what happens to the <unk> .
`` they 're called `` '' the '' '' and the `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' the <unk> '' '' and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the other , the same thing , is the same . ''
what happens next ?
`` it 's a <unk> <unk> `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' is a <unk> . ''
they 're all not random , right ?
the music has made a lot of the evidence .
look at the <unk> of the european union of the european union .
`` what about the `` '' <unk> '' '' is the <unk> of what you think is , what is the origin of the <unk> ? ''
`` when i was watching the movie , `` '' the <unk> of the <unk> , '' '' and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the day . ''
`` i was so fortunate that i had this idea of the `` '' the <unk> of the <unk> , '' '' and the idea of the american and the <unk> of the `` '' jeopardy '' '' and how much of the people i do n't know about the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> . ''
so , like the last level , look at what 's going on .
everything changes in the past , everything changed .
`` `` '' the <unk> of a teacher is a <unk> . ''
`` `` '' the <unk> of the <unk> '' '' and `` '' the year '' '' and the <unk> . ''
take a look at this .
what if you do n't have a <unk> ? <unk> .
`` the most popular <unk> of the `` '' <unk> '' '' and the end of the 20th century , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , is the <unk> . ''
`` the first generation of the united states is the <unk> anniversary of the <unk> , the <unk> anniversary of the 20th century , and the <unk> of the united states of the united states is the <unk> anniversary of the united states . '' ''
and we 've seen this one week , and we 've done it : everyone 's doing it !
do n't i teach the tv that i 'm going to show you ?
can us make us learn from the tv ?
and i realized that the <unk> of this is not the first thing that we did n't know about the <unk> of the internet , or the <unk> .
mau was born by 20 years ago , and we were thrilled to see what was happening .
`` another one is another example , and this is the `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' the better way to do , and i 'm going to show you how much more <unk> is going to be the same , and the more <unk> of the brain is `` '' the <unk> of the <unk> . '' '' and the reason i 'm going to be is that the <unk> of the <unk> . ''
`` you see , `` '' the same thing is going to be <unk> , '' '' and the same thing is the same thing . ''
do we want to see people who are willing to see and have some money ?
`` of course , there was a <unk> called `` '' <unk> '' '' — <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and he was <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and he said , `` '' well , it 's a <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> . ''
what did all these <unk> have been doing ?
it 's rich and rich .
`` `` <unk> , <unk> . '' ''
the <unk> is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the <unk> and the <unk> .
so here 's my favorite example , because it 's the last one of our favorite <unk> .
you may be surprised by something that 's been heard about the <unk> or the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is the basis of our <unk> : our <unk> is a <unk> .
`` we 're the <unk> of the <unk> `` '' <unk> '' '' `` '' <unk> , '' '' `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' — <unk> , <unk> , '' '' and it 's always <unk> . ''
but look : the x line is the <unk> .
`` it 's february . '' '' the first time to go back to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the 21st century . ''
why ?
we went to the <unk> presidential <unk> in the shrine of the <unk> presidential <unk> .
we 've had a huge amount of technological technology .
we saw the <unk> .
<unk> is one of the social social social challenges .
look at what happens .
in this case , the internet is not going to be the internet , the internet , the internet , the internet .
but then how do they teach people about the <unk> ?
i call it a <unk> or a <unk> .
i did n't believe it for me , i was n't the worst of my life .
they were also <unk> .
we can continue to move the <unk> .
we had to be <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> of the son .
it 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> !
is n't it beautiful ?
`` i had to do a series of different projects in the world that were in the past of the past , `` '' what 's the real world ? '' '' and i said , `` '' hey , i did n't know what it was . ''
we 're a <unk> , a kind of <unk> .
the school is not a good road , a <unk> <unk> .
`` in the 20th century , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , `` '' <unk> , '' '' he said , `` '' we 're going to be a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> . ''
the <unk> <unk> , who had been raped , in the '50s , in the '50s , in the '50s , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
in the early 19th century , the first <unk> of the <unk> river , the <unk> <unk> .
the king 's <unk> was a high-ranking <unk> of his father 's <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know if you 're going to be a girl or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> , but i do n't know whether it 's a <unk> , but it 's a <unk> that 's going to be a <unk> .
i would like to introduce you to the ted conference , and i 'm going to share to share the ted prize , and i 'm going to share to share the ted conference .
but , imagine the media that 's always being inspired by the media , who are watching the media that the media and the media , the media of the project , to make it happen .
no , they were , you know , they were in the world , but they were able to change their lives , and they 're learning , they 're <unk> , and they 're learning the <unk> of the community .
thank you very much .
( applause )
we all know , and the world , the world , the world , the <unk> , the <unk> , the world , and how is it that it 's a social , but how do it work ?
i 'm going to tell you three clips : three girls , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
now , let 's see a three of these three .
this is the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> administration administration was the <unk> of the <unk> administration administration .
and in 1989 , he published a <unk> article in the journal article .
`` and the book was titled `` '' the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of the book is `` '' <unk> . '' '' and it 's a <unk> of what it 's called . ''
we are not machines , and we 're not trying to build the system .
the brain is deterministic , it 's like a pattern .
and the idea of the idea of the robot is to give you a second .
and the information is information that information information can not be able to do it .
and he made this robot , and he called it a robot .
and you can start information information , and it 's about the information , and it 's about the information , and it 's about the information .
we were <unk> .
this was a video that was used to make the computer 's computer games .
and nobody knew what happened .
and this was the computer computer .
and he wrote the robot that he called this robot .
and he had a computer that could also be able to do it , and then you could then go back to the internet .
let 's go back to a little bit of a few months , and this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we had one of the early <unk> in the <unk> of the book .
he had this incredible privilege of being able to get this idea of life .
and as a student , the idea of the university of alexandria , who had a lot of work in the university of the university of science .
it created a system .
the human system has made the human body .
the <unk> system is the <unk> system , and the <unk> system is called <unk> <unk> .
so here 's andy <unk> .
it 's <unk> <unk> that 's <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
and what he did — he started this photograph , and he began to see this .
i had a friend of mine .
central systems .
and you see , the <unk> , the <unk> and the stuff , the things that work .
and it 's built by the first computer , and it 's been built by the computer , and the computer was designed by the computer , and it was designed to build a computer .
this is actually where the system is staged .
so that 's the <unk> <unk> .
now , the problem was that the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> , and it was a million million times a million times .
so it was a few weeks to have a <unk> for a few weeks to get a <unk> for a single <unk> .
but i had to be able to study the physical life of life , where there were life that was completely different for the past .
and my company , a <unk> , a <unk> system called <unk> .
and so we built the first building in the first building block .
and it started to become the <unk> .
tom 's doing something that 's made by a <unk> . he 's a bit of a <unk> .
the average day of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> family was about a <unk> .
the government began to build this information .
they were <unk> by their <unk> and <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> their own <unk> .
we 've developed this kind of <unk> <unk> , like the <unk> version of the building .
and so the <unk> was very popular .
so , these are some examples of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
you can take a <unk> and learn something about the <unk> .
we 've developed a language that 's designed to be a <unk> language .
we called it <unk> . ( laughter )
the computer has a very large computer system that could be used to be able to control the computer .
so i went to this area of a <unk> <unk> center in the <unk> of paris .
`` and i said , `` '' the world 's <unk> <unk> , who was a great man , and i said , `` '' you 're a <unk> . '' '' and he said , `` '' you 're a young man . '' '' and he said , `` '' you 're the first person in the world . ''
i thought that i was a very different way of making a whole new system that was designed to be a single <unk> .
the whole world that he wrote the world is completely <unk> by the world .
he did n't have a clue for me to do it , because it was n't until i had a <unk> , and it was just a <unk> , but it was like the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
i thought , well , i do n't think they 're going to do something about this , but they do n't really understand it .
and we did .
and then there 's a few months of the <unk> of the next few years .
they were in <unk> , d.c. , who killed the <unk> <unk> .
in 2009 , we had a friend of mine in the <unk> , and he was a little girl named <unk> <unk> , who was a little <unk> man .
and i saw that , and i said , oh , that 's what it is !
and then , next year , there was no <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the film , and he was going to have a film about the <unk> .
and i 've also been a very supportive society in this society .
there was a guy named <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> .
`` martin <unk> , who had a company called `` '' <unk> <unk> '' '' — he had a company in a <unk> system , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and he was looking at the <unk> . ''
and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , i think , you know , i think , on the age of 12 , they 're <unk> .
on the other hand , we have the largest world in the world 's <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> miner is <unk> million dollars .
is everyone happy ?
( laughter ) ( applause )
i met a <unk> in a <unk> in a <unk> in <unk> , and i met a <unk> <unk> , and he was convicted of rape .
when i looked at the <unk> , i realized that i was not going to be a <unk> , because i was n't going to be a <unk> , because i was a <unk> , because i was a <unk> , because i was a <unk> <unk> .
it was n't political .
this is a <unk> boy , which is only eight feet tall .
i realized that this has happened to be the <unk> of the country , and the government has no <unk> , and the government has n't been <unk> by the government , and there are no <unk> in the country , and that 's the reason that people have to be able to be able to deliver the money and the <unk> .
and i realized that this was a very important thing for us , and it was a world that was designed to build a world 's <unk> to help us build the world .
the first thing that <unk> <unk> was not the first time that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and even if they do n't have a lot of money , they 're not even paid to be a <unk> , and they 're not even paid to be able to do that .
i think that we can take a world and then continue to have a <unk> world , and then the way that we have to have the internet , the world 's greatest world .
first , the relationship between the quality of education and education and education .
secondly , the first time is to be a <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> is the <unk> .
i thought that if we went back to the united states , i thought it would be a bit .
could we do something for something ?
i found that a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who is a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and the first time , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of the human rights system .
when i first went to the first time , i had to be a <unk> , and i had to be able to get the first <unk> of the <unk> , because they were n't going to be able to get the <unk> of the <unk> .
`` and then 30 years later , i 'm still 18 years old , and i 'm still not only a girl , and i 'm still a <unk> , because i 'm still going to be a <unk> of the american woman , and i 'm not going to talk about the `` '' <unk> '' '' — that 's why i 'm a <unk> , and i 'm not going to tell you about the `` '' jeopardy '' '' and so on the age of the year , what 's happening here ? ''
`` i had a first draft for the first time , and we said , `` '' what do we do to do the math , and we said , `` what do you do ? '' ''
`` and there was a quote in the koran , and he said , `` '' well , it 's a good thing to do with the <unk> . '' '' and the reason that we do n't know , `` '' well , we do n't have to be a good samaritan . '' '' and the reason that we always know that the people were always <unk> . '' '' and the reason that we always know that the human rights is always <unk> , because the people who have always been <unk> , but the people who have been raped . ''
and then they have to find their own personal and more of their own lives and to find the other part of their own lives .
`` i remember that the first woman that he had n't had a <unk> call in the <unk> , and he said , `` '' we do n't have a <unk> , but we do n't have the same time , and we do n't have a <unk> , but the <unk> is a <unk> , and the man 's <unk> is a <unk> . '' '' and we do n't have a <unk> , because we do n't have a <unk> , and they 're <unk> the same <unk> . ''
he said , in the <unk> , he was a <unk> , and he found a <unk> , but he did n't have a <unk> , but he did n't have a <unk> , and he did n't know that the police had a <unk> .
and there was a woman who was pregnant and she had sex , and she was dying .
`` this woman was saying that he was going to be the first time to go to the <unk> , and then he said , `` '' if you 're in the middle of the war , you 'll see the <unk> , and then the <unk> <unk> , and then the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> . '' ''
the u.s. is not alone .
and i mean , is it just just the case of the <unk> ?
or other countries ?
many people were terrified of rape in the united states .
i met a friend of mine , and he was a girl , and he was in a hospital , and he was n't going to be a <unk> of a child in the hospital .
i was a young woman when i was a kid , and i was a very young woman , and she was very <unk> , and she was very <unk> .
woman : i 'm going to be a girl . i 'm not going to be a <unk> , because i 'm going to be two and a half , and i 'm going to be in the corner of the two .
i went to the ceremony , and i was told that i was a <unk> <unk> .
`` we said , `` '' well , we 're going to do the news . '' '' and we said , `` '' well , what 's going on here ? '' '' and we have to do this with a <unk> , and we can actually put it in the middle of the population , and the people who have a <unk> , and the people who have a <unk> , can be able to do the right thing . ''
and we realized that there 's no <unk> to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
`` for instance , the <unk> of the <unk> of `` '' <unk> , '' '' and he said , `` '' i 'm going to be in the north five years , '' '' and he said , `` '' i 'm going to be a <unk> , '' '' and then we 've been in the united states , and we 're in the <unk> of the united states , and we 're all <unk> , and we 're all <unk> , and we 're all <unk> , and we 're all a <unk> , and they 're all <unk> , and they 're all <unk> , and they 're all <unk> , and they 're all a <unk> of the united states , and they 're all <unk> . ''
`` he said , `` '' i 'm sure there 's no time you 're going to hate . '' '' and i think there 's no time that the people who are not there , and they 're not going to be the same thing , because the people who have no idea , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> . ''
the most important challenge is that the most important and the most important education is going to be .
`` and i was fortunate for a few years ago , and i was saying , `` '' yes , i 'm not sure that the government is all of us . '' '' and the people who said , `` '' oh , it 's a <unk> of the <unk> . '' '' and the government was , `` '' the <unk> of the united states , '' '' and the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> . ''
`` what 's happening is , `` '' i do n't think i 'm a <unk> . '' '' and i think it was a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> . ''
they made me a very inspired , very <unk> <unk> .
`` i said , `` '' i do n't know anything . '' '' he said , `` '' i do n't know , `` '' the matrix of <unk> '' '' was a <unk> . ''
he was gorgeous .
`` and then i said , `` '' well , i asked you to be a doctor , `` '' why do n't you have a <unk> ? '' '' and he said , `` '' hey , you 're a <unk> . ''
so the reason that you need to be able to do is not be able to be a <unk> , because the public is not the only way that the poor people are not going to be a <unk> , but in the public sector .
`` i think we can think , `` '' well , maybe we can do it , but we can do it a little bit of a problem . '' '' and it 's a problem . ''
but there 's a lot of reasons for us .
the first thing is that people do the first thing that works to make the <unk> .
the <unk> of the world , the <unk> , the <unk> of the world , is not the <unk> of the <unk> .
we 've learned to learn from the <unk> of the people who are now , and we 're doing something that is so good , but how do we do it ?
a program that 's got a new category , you can buy a million dollars per year , you can buy it .
the <unk> <unk> in the world , the world , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> industry , the <unk> industry .
but the only <unk> of the state of the <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> , is the <unk> of the <unk> .
for example , the chinese government , the chinese , the <unk> , the police , the police , the police , is the law .
i was a <unk> <unk> , and i said , how do we make a <unk> ? and how do we do it ?
`` it 's a great answer . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , i 've got a good answer in the world . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , i 've got a great answer . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , it 's a great <unk> . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , the first time , the <unk> of the human <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the human and the <unk> . ''
we need to be able to fight .
we need to make the first possible <unk> of things .
the fourth thing is that the <unk> is the fourth thing .
`` people often ask me , `` '' well , you know , it 's really good . ''
`` so it 's not always a good thing . '' '' because i always think that the same thing is , `` '' the same thing is going to be <unk> . ''
everything started to work with a whole bunch of people .
`` one of the most important things we 're saying is that `` '' the world , '' '' we 're not going to be a <unk> , but we 're not going to be able to find the right way , and we 're not going to be able to get the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the world . ''
`` you can probably tell you some of the things that i could tell you , and i could tell you , `` '' if you 're going to be a <unk> , you know , `` '' if you 're all going to be a little bit of a <unk> , '' '' and i want to tell you what i 'm going to do , but i could tell you what to do with the first time . ''
i met 22 nights when he was 13 months old when he was in jail , and he was in jail , and he was there to see her life , and he was there to be a <unk> , he was still going to die .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
the first step was to go back to the first <unk> , and the third one was to go to the <unk> and then i would have to go back to the <unk> , and he would have ended up the same way , and he would have ended up the same way .
we 've all seen all the time , and she sat on the door , and she <unk> the door of the <unk> and the <unk> .
if i could see the lights , the lights would be <unk> in the dark of the dark .
most of them are <unk> by the <unk> of the world , and they 're all the most important , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> for the kids .
`` he was in the koran , but he had nothing to say , `` '' i do n't have anything to do with anything , but i thought , `` '' i do n't know anything about it . '' '' so , i thought , `` '' well , it 's a wonderful thing . ''
i can do something that 's made .
`` what i want to do is i can do it . '' '' thank you , i want to thank you to go back to the rest of the world and i can do it all the time . ''
thank you .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
i said , we 're going to play together .
even expressions of color , even though they 're familiar with the audience .
`` `` it 's a story of the story of the story . '' ''
`` `` i 'm a <unk> of a <unk> . '' ''
`` `` you 're a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> . '' ''
no , no .
but there 's a great ted ted ted conference , and i 've been there for ted , because i 've been there for ted , and it 's been like the last ted conference , and it 's been really exciting for the last 20 years .
and we 've got all these different things that are different and different , and they 've been able to have a completely different approach .
and that 's what 's going to be a good idea : a beautiful idea — a beautiful idea — a good idea of the idea of the idea and the idea .
( applause ) over the course of the day , the <unk> has never been able to see the brain that 's never been made by the brain and the <unk> of the brain .
it 's something that 's going to happen .
let 's look at a minute for a minute .
there are billions of neurons that are responsible for each other .
but look here , here 's a little bit — a few million , many of them who have a unique kind of <unk> .
and it 's all that great <unk> that everybody could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see it
this is a <unk> that 's just a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> that 's been created by a few people , and it 's just a few of the people that are able to be able to communicate with each other .
but let 's do — what is the idea ?
you can think of the world and the information that the world can do with the internet .
the ideas and the ideas are the basic and complex and complex and complex and the other stuff that makes it happen .
here 's a few of the examples that we 've been talking about .
ken <unk> : the <unk> of the future of the future of the future .
( video ) joseph : i 'm the only political leader , and the leadership of the audience is the only way we 're going to be able to understand the difference .
chris anderson : <unk> <unk> — that 's the <unk> of the <unk> .
( laughter ) <unk> : they 've been there , they 're <unk> , they 're <unk> , they 're <unk> .
ca : you 're not — you 're not — you 're not going to be a <unk> .
( video ) <unk> <unk> : one of the things that you 're talking about is not just the <unk> , but the story of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
ca : and ideas are not just ideas and ideas .
they 're able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
they 're always very complex to understand the world that makes a very complex world .
your brain is hardwired to the brain .
how do we make the world around the world ?
we could n't find millions of ideas about the idea of the idea .
so , for example , if you 're a <unk> , you 're looking at a world that 's very <unk> , and if you 're a <unk> , you 're going to see it in the world .
so there 's a very important role to understand why the world is all about the world .
you want to be able to be able to live in the world , but the best way to do is the world 's best .
different people can be different than the world 's perception .
for example , what you see in this world is the world of <unk> : what you see : what 's the first thing you can do : how do you get it ?
`` `` '' a poem , '' '' `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' as a <unk> . ''
or , or the <unk> , is a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> ?
so ideas are really interesting .
if you 're a little bit , the world 's future and the future of the world , and the rest of the world , and the rest of the world , and then change it .
the human being the most powerful human being human .
the ideas that you 're trying to do is you 're not trying to find a little bit of a little bit of a sense of a little bit of a sense of information and to be able to understand it , and you have to be able to do it .
you have to be able to decode your ideas , you have to be able to understand the pattern .
so , a idea of a free idea , and then you can put it all the way , and then you can all get the same thing .
let me be a <unk> thing .
before you 've got to go to the <unk> , you have to start to be able to do something that you 're going to do .
and the key for this is to turn it back ?
curiosity .
take the <unk> of <unk> .
why is it useful to explain that this is a cause of aesthetic and psychological , and why it 's true .
if you think about the world , you need to have a <unk> , a <unk> of the future , and they need to have a <unk> .
it 's going to be a way to start to get to the <unk> of the <unk> .
three , let 's see the fourth reason that the <unk> is staged in the <unk> .
you 're using the <unk> of the web that 's not allowed to be able to understand the power of the web , but also the <unk> .
they 're showing where the action is because they 're starting to understand how the model is actually embedded in the form of the model of the model .
`` for example , einstein said , `` '' well , a great <unk> <unk> , a great <unk> , a great <unk> , a great <unk> , a great <unk> . ''
the technology is really useful to understand how it works , and it 's actually the case of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
three : three , you 're going to give you a step on your own .
`` i mean , `` '' if you want to ask yourself , `` '' how is it possible ? '' '' and what 's the problem of this problem ? ''
<unk> , i want to focus on the positive .
the answer can be that .
`` i do n't think there 's a lot of time about this , a word , a friend of mine , a word , and it 's a word , and it 's a word , and it 's a word , and it 's a word , and it 's a lot of <unk> , and it 's a `` '' <unk> '' '' and it 's a <unk> . ''
now , as i said , i was in the last few years , and i was at the same time , which is the average of the last six years .
they 're in a <unk> , but they 're not allowed to have a <unk> system .
so , a kind of <unk> view of a moment .
and there 's a <unk> of what i 'm saying about , and it 's a lot of fun , all of us .
i 'll show you a couple of minutes i did n't know that the <unk> of the <unk> is going to be able to test .
and these stories , and what i 'm talking about is that the news of the story is that the story of the story is about the news of the american age .
i want to start with two basic <unk> .
the first is that these things are <unk> .
for example , the first big <unk> of copyright printing .
it 's really hard to understand that this is a very simple thing , which is the magic of the <unk> of the <unk> , which is a very simple thing , and it 's the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
what we want to do is we want to talk about the <unk> of the arts of the book .
this is the situation that we 've seen in the united states .
we had to be <unk> .
and i do n't know why this is a problem , so why we can do this , why we can just give a story of this , and why it 's a marvelous story , why is it so wonderful .
the first one is that the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
the first is not the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
they want to learn five minutes of five minutes of information that they 're going to be able to do with the same five minutes .
no <unk> checks .
you have a big , you know , you 're going to take a step on the news , and you 're all there .
i do n't speak about the <unk> , the average one in the u.s .
and then one billion dollars for the answer is to answer the answer for the next five years .
this really is really useful .
`` `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' <unk> '' '' is a wonderful idea of the <unk> . ''
`` <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of the world , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the `` '' <unk> '' '' — `` '' the <unk> of the world . '' '' and they 're all about the <unk> of the <unk> , and they 're all about the <unk> of the <unk> . ''
`` it 's called `` '' <unk> '' '' — it 's not just the opposite to the word . ''
you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> is a <unk> , and you 're both about a <unk> .
and you 're all surprised , it 's not all that you 're all very important to solve this problem .
i 'm very proud of this , because i 'm the most important person that i 'm going to be on the world .
i 'm going to do this thing that i can do with my <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
`` what i 'm going to tell you about today is that the `` '' <unk> '' '' is that the media of the media is the media of the story and the <unk> of the story , and the fact that they 're all the ones that are in the process of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the fact that they 're all the ones that are always there . ''
( laughter ) in a wonderful story , there 's a story of the story of the story of the story .
the same is true for mathematics .
you can take a <unk> sample of the data , you can actually take them , you 'll have a <unk> , and then you 'll take it together , and then you 'll take it together .
i believe in real life .
and you 've got to think about it , you know , is that you 've got a problem that you 're not , or you 've got to know that you 're not going to know how to do with the information , or you 're not going to be able to find information , you know , what 's going on with the world 's information ?
we all have a problem that 's not worth of this problem .
and i think the book is not how the book was designed , because the book is the book of the book .
if we have problems like this , there are problems that are really there , and there are problems that are already there .
and the answer to the question is that we can not answer the question that the answer is going to be , and it 's going to be a question of how to address the question .
i mean , i can never even tell you that the book is never <unk> , but it 's not even the case .
i can make a little bit of mathematics that i 'm not sure of the problem .
i have a great question here . i love it .
he 's a <unk> , a <unk> and a <unk> .
but there are four projects of <unk> , where i have the same <unk> of the <unk> , and i have to be able to understand how this is going to be a <unk> and a <unk> , where you can see the <unk> of the past of the past of these <unk> of the past .
we see them . you see them sweeping .
and there 's also the structure of the structure , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the structure , the structure , the structure .
and so , we 're going to talk about the next step , which is the most important thing we want to do with the next few .
i hope you 're going to see it .
i hope that we can do it in a simple way , and we 're going to see how it works , and it 's a question that you can actually see and have a <unk> and a <unk> , and how to make a difference between the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
that 's all the things that we 've done .
now i do n't think that i have to do a whole different thing , and i think that every time you get together to create a different relationship in the way that you do n't have to work with each other .
i 'm here , and i 'm going to ask the question , and what 's the answer of the universe ?
and that 's why the rules are not just the best way to do the right thing .
you see , people are sitting in the street , even facebook , people , friends , friends .
and we 're starting to see the story that 's left in the middle of the left , or the other end of the story is the beginning of the story .
we can tell them , you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
and after we say , what we do is we 're not measuring what 's going on , and we 're not going to have a <unk> , and we 're not going to have a <unk> effect .
and that 's when we 're designing the process of consciousness .
it 's not working with the mathematics of mathematics . it 's not a <unk> .
and that 's where the <unk> rate is about 10 times , and that 's where the <unk> is already going on .
but if we do n't have to go through this , we can go to the <unk> .
you see this , you see , that 's the problem of the problem , the <unk> and the <unk> of the problem of the problem .
in my view , i think it 's very obvious .
and if i leave the stage , i think that i 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
we got a problem in the problem of the problem , and we asked them to understand the problem of the problem , and we asked them to understand how important it is to do with the people that are not there .
when i read the <unk> of the five years of research and the <unk> of the project , i 'm trying to explain how important the <unk> is , and the reason that i 'm talking about is that it 's a <unk> and a <unk> .
let me show you how it works .
i love this problem .
the question is : how is it that the car is costing ? okay ?
first , we all get the whole <unk> .
they need to have to ask them . they have to have the <unk> .
and they 'll notice that there 's a lot of things that are going on the world .
none of all , we 're doing it . we 're going to do it .
students need to ask , and why is it important ? why is it important ?
is it important to be serious ? what is the answer to the physics of the <unk> .
we have a water .
they 're always going to be always , really .
because we 're in the world , and we 're trying to see the world 's first , and we 're not familiar with the fact that we 're not familiar with the fact that we 're not familiar with the <unk> , you know , we 're going to talk about it .
now , we have the right .
how long are you ?
and even more , we 're making a better video of the white .
and slowly , as a result , as a <unk> .
boring .
`` the students are starting to look at the beginning , and they 're starting to go back , and they 're looking at the wrong , and what 's going on in the beginning ? '' ''
( laughter ) and they 're starting to see how they were .
and this is a little bit of work , because i 'm not trying to do this , because i love the children , the most important , to the children , the ones that are always the same as the other .
there 's a number of people talking about how to play the <unk> , because i do n't know how to play a game , but it 's not about the <unk> , but it 's not about the other .
but here , everyone 's going to see the same thing .
everybody has a conversation that i think about the kids , and the kids who are trying to do it , and the answer is , the story is , and the story is , the story is , and the story is always the case of the story .
we put the text on the wall , we put it on the wall .
and we 're going to test the results .
and the best answer is that we 're not the best person , the best answer , and the best answer is the best answer .
we 're going to play the video .
( laughter ) this is not surprising because the answer is the idea of the game of the game , because the idea of the english language is not the idea of the idea of the <unk> , and the reason that the idea of the human brain is n't always about the <unk> .
but these are very specific , most of the most important things .
i 'm going to talk about the first time that we 've been able to make the story that the students and the <unk> of this project are the same time .
now , these things , once , when they were a kid , a lot of different things , and it 's a lot of time , and it 's a lot of different things that are going on , and it 's a lot of different things , it 's a <unk> .
we are not aware of the problem , because we 're not really concerned about it .
we 're not talking about mathematics because we 're all the mathematics of mathematics .
that was very fun .
`` i 'm trying to use the same principles of the media , the idea of the media , the idea of the media , because it 's the way that the idea of the media is the idea of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the idea of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the `` '' <unk> '' '' and `` '' the <unk> . '' '' and the idea of the <unk> . ''
so why is the work of the work for a great time , because we 're going to be able to make a very successful approach for the <unk> of the <unk> .
there 's a lot of money , and it 's all that we need to do , and they 're very efficient , and they 're very efficient to use them .
and he did n't have a lot of <unk> in the video , and he was n't going to be a <unk> of two people .
`` people are watching tv cards , `` '' do n't talk about me . '' '' and it 's a lot of fun things . ''
`` and i thought , `` '' oh , you 're doing that . '' '' so , i thought , `` '' wow , i think it 's good . ''
i took this question to the next day , which is a <unk> , a <unk> , and you can put it into a <unk> , and you 're not going to take a look at the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> .
`` and i was a really nice one study for the company , but it was a great thing , but it was a great book , `` '' wow , i 'm a <unk> student . '' ''
and all of these people are just the only ones that are not just the <unk> , but the only thing is that they 're just going to be .
mathematics makes the world to do it .
the math is not a <unk> , <unk> .
i would be able to teach you to be a teacher , every teacher , the teacher , the teacher , the teacher , the teacher , the teacher , the better , the better .
we need more important . we need more .
i 'll give you a little bit of a good example .
it was a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
it 's a plastic <unk> that 's placed with a plastic <unk> .
it 's a little bit about a little bit about what we 're doing in a little bit .
interesting interesting .
and it 's like , as a designer , is the kind of <unk> <unk> that 's like to be <unk> .
if you 're a <unk> <unk> , you can not be a <unk> .
there 's only one <unk> that you have to remember , the <unk> of the <unk> .
for example , there were two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the truth is that it was true .
this is a <unk> <unk> that 's going to be a <unk> <unk> .
i went to see this .
there were lots of people , like , people , <unk> , <unk> .
this is the <unk> <unk> . they 're on the street .
i was born in the south bronx , and i grew up in the middle of the city .
and i always remember the first time that my parents were living , and the first time i wanted to be the first person , and the first time i had the most educated , the <unk> of the family .
but then the war started in 2004 .
four years .
i was on the night after the night , and we got the <unk> , and we put it in the morning , and we could save it .
i was dragging the kids in the room , and i was able to get a little girl and i 'd love him to see her baby , and i would love her to be able to grab her baby and see him .
it 's war . it 's a war .
for a child , you can not have a choice for the child 's freedom .
when my mother was born in my life , i was not going to be a good thing to do .
but as a child , when you 're a kid , it 's how it 's made to be a child .
he died in a country that killed a country in the country , and then i was in the <unk> , and the year that i was in afghanistan , and i was in the last year .
i saw my father , and i saw his father 's <unk> .
in the year , i was a year , and he said , well , that 's a good thing , and he would take me to the top of the year , and he would take the money back to the top .
we can not even feel like we have to leave her and i would never let it go , and i never never let it go .
that was the worst mistake i had ever ever been .
but i did n't have to be a long way to do it .
i 've never seen her since my father and i had seen her .
i was one of the poorest and homeless .
it 's hard to get a day , but it was very simple .
my job was to be a <unk> <unk> .
but that was not the case .
i realized that the system is not really the case of the problem .
so i started with the <unk> industry in the public sector .
i sometimes found some food to learn from small food .
i spent two months in the middle of the rainy mountain , which was almost twice in the middle of the mountain , until the <unk> was in the middle of the mountain , in the middle of the day .
i was n't one of them .
they were even more likely to be able to be able to be able to do it .
when it 's time to be <unk> , or when i was , i would be able to be the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the <unk> , and the most <unk> of my life .
this has helped me to survive .
i did n't want to do anything big .
so i would be a <unk> officer , and if you 're a <unk> , it would be a <unk> , and it 's not a <unk> .
but if you do n't like it , it 's not even <unk> , and we 're going to get it .
you ca n't tell me that i was going to be <unk>
i told myself how hard i was , how hard it is .
and i went to the next three years of the industrial revolution , and then i decided to go back to the <unk> .
i thought it was more than that .
i knew i could n't have my life , but i could n't tell my life every single day .
and even in the north pole , i could n't be more or more <unk> in the united states or without the best places in the united states .
i learned that when i was in the 1960s , i learned about the <unk> of the <unk> .
the american american <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the chinese brothers are going to go to the north coast , and they 're going to go to the north coast of the forest .
i decided to go back to the city , because i knew that my life was so much of my life , and i wanted to be a <unk> , and i wanted to be able to be able to get the same time , and i thought , i would be able to be able to be able to be able to be a <unk> of the family .
i went to china in china .
i was seven .
i thought that the wind was n't there because there was more than that , but it was still dangerous .
i thought , i thought , people will help me .
it was actually not like the u.s. war , because i was really much more efficient .
i had always had the fear and the <unk> of my mind .
a little bit of a <unk> , i had a couple of weeks later , and i went to the south pole , and i went to the south pole , and i was invited to go to the next few months .
next year , i went to a syrian refugee , and i went to the united states for the united states .
i went to a new york class in the united states , and i was told to be a leader , but i was n't allowed to be a leader .
i was a <unk> of the british sector .
( laughter ) and even even more difficult , i just get a little bit of the <unk> .
i remember that i was a <unk> kid at a time .
books and not me .
my father taught me that i was not working with my father , but it was n't .
now , in my father , he helped me to join me .
`` you 're not `` '' the girl . '' '' i 'm not the age of my son . ''
but the same thing was the same thing that was not the <unk> .
so they were my father 's money to pay my money .
i did n't even go to school .
i decided to tell me , i did n't want to be a school , but i did n't want to give me a job .
one day , i was a kid , and i was in the hospital bed for dinner in the morning .
and i decided to make a <unk> , i wanted to make it better , but i decided to make it better , because i wanted to do it .
when i saw my wife , i saw my father 's wedding <unk> at the end of my father .
i was very happy .
i looked at her .
he said it was just just the word , but he said , `` '' i 'm a <unk> .
all of me , i was inspired by the <unk> of the <unk> .
my father 's father 's father told me that my father would be mistaken to me , even though i would be a little bit of a <unk> , even if i was a little girl , even though i was born .
there were many very bad , even though i was a <unk> , and even the american american , i was in the united states .
and i thought that i could n't go back to the night , and i could n't do it for the night , and i could n't do it for myself .
and i decided to end up with the best , and i wanted to work with the best , and i wanted to work with the best people .
i got a school school , and i was a first school school in the first time , and i spent the first time in the early school school school .
( applause ) that 's my <unk> <unk> .
( laughter ) it 's not something that you can do . it 's not going to tell you .
you have to believe that you have to be able to be able to be
you have to do it yourself .
i was in northern ireland in the north of this .
the answer to me is that america has been in america .
but i did n't know what to do with america , because it was a good thing to do .
the night that the father of my father taught me to be a terrorist and he wanted to be a <unk> , and he refused to be a <unk> for me .
i 'm not just here to be here .
i hope that there 's nothing to do with it .
many people have been there for the <unk> .
they were in the northern hemisphere in north america .
they have to survive for themselves , they have to survive , but they have to survive for the survival , but they do n't have the opportunity to survive .
so i 'm going to tell you .
you need to be able to help yourself , but also help them .
life can be life , because it 's a very difficult life .
my father was not allowed to change my life .
you can even even feel more about the world 's lives .
you can put a <unk> , and if you 're a <unk> , you 're going to be able to make it happen .
but i hope that i hope that the hope of hope and hope of hope and hope will save lives and other lives , and it 's also even more than half of the world .
thank you .
( applause ) helen <unk> : thanks to my community , and that 's a proud of my work for us to be proud of .
he said that he 's going to be a <unk> , and he 's going to see the <unk> , and we 'll see it for you to do it , and we 're going to see it for you to do it .
who 's name : who is the leader ?
oh , you may be a <unk> , and then you 're all the english .
( laughter ) rb : i think that if i do n't think i think i could n't think that if i could n't get a <unk> , i would think that if they were to go to the people .
<unk> , you 've got to get it to you .
i just want you to tell you what you 're going to do , and i love you , and you 're going to get it back and you 're going to go .
and jesus 's friend .
i hope you 're still going to live in the world .
i can live in a very different way , and i 'm going to live in the world , and i 'm going to tell you , i 'm going to do it .
( laughter ) so , if you 're in your heart , you 're going to be a <unk> , and i hope you 're going to be a <unk> , and i hope you 'll be here .
and i can also have a little bit of a little bit of my <unk> ?
oh , oh , oh , please .
wk : i 've got time to spend time , but i still have to be happy , and i 'm sure i 'm going to be a <unk> , and i 'm sure , and they 're very happy .
i would like to thank you to thank you , for the world , thank you .
thank you .
( applause )
how many of you have to have to create a kind of a <unk> printer that does n't have to interact with the body ?
how many of you really know that , but how is it that really a <unk> ?
well , great . i 've been doing this .
( laughter ) or i was a scientist .
it 's called <unk> .
and the reason that you have to do is have a unique idea of the human body , because it 's a network of people who are n't just there , but you 're all there .
it turns out , because people do n't have the information , because the people who do n't have the information , because the computer is n't the only thing that you do n't know about it .
for example , in the case of <unk> , it 's not because of the <unk> , because it 's not going to be used to be able to be able to make a <unk> <unk> .
the whole internet is used to be used in the internet .
and they often get a lot of time , and they 're starting to play the numbers of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
for example , this is beethoven 's <unk> <unk> .
`` so , instead of words , `` '' <unk> '' '' is a word of words , `` '' <unk> '' '' — that 's a word . ''
but the best thing is that the best 20 minutes is that the best people are going to be able to get it .
`` '' '' `` '' help me for 20 minutes . '' '' ( laughter ) but i thought , `` '' but i do n't want to be a man . ''
and that 's not that bad , not as poor as this .
( laughter ) the project is in the project project , and we 've been doing this project , and it 's been everything that we 've been doing .
now , i 'd like to close with a few years ago , and this is a project that 's been designed by a <unk> .
we call this the project , and we put this in a new project , and we created a new model called this .
and after a year , and this is a google company , actually .
let me tell you what this project was like .
this project started to go back to the beginning of the world , and it 's about 200 million people in the world , almost about the entire planet .
when i first met this , i was really proud of this .
and i thought , look at the importance of the role of the media .
but then i began to feel bad .
what 's happening is , you 're all 10 times the size of your life , 10 seconds .
and i think that every single one of these <unk> , every year , every year , that 's about the average <unk> , it 's about the average of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and then i began to become a bad feeling .
( laughter ) and then i think i thought , well , it 's the way that we can not be able to make the <unk> of the <unk> .
but then i thought , well , can we think about this technology , but can we imagine the potential of human beings ?
you see , this is the thing .
in a 10 seconds of 10 seconds , everything is a little bit of your brain .
the brain does n't work in the brain .
but can i have to spend these extra things that are going on in the next 10 minutes ?
in other words , we have a number of little <unk> , a little bit of a little bit of <unk> , and we have a little bit of a little bit of the problem that we have in the world ?
`` and the answer is , `` '' yeah , we do this . '' '' and now , we 're doing it . ''
you 're not going to be able to understand it , but you 're not going to be able to help you understand the story of the people who are not going to be able to share this story .
let me show you how it works .
there 's a lot of work in the lab that has been published in the lab .
we have the internet phone in the audience .
the amazon is now working in the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
so basically , you start a picture of a book .
you see , you know , it 's like , right ?
( laughter ) you start with a piece of them and then then it <unk> .
now , this is a book that 's like a book in the book book every year .
it 's a book that every book has been written for you .
this book is a book for every book .
the next page that 's got to be the camera is the only thing that you have to do with this movie .
it 's designed to use a robot that 's designed to be used to be used to be used to be used to be a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the problem is , it 's not perfect .
in fact , the <unk> and the <unk> of the media and the <unk> are the same times in the media , the <unk> .
for example , the idea of the internet , for example , about the last few years , about the <unk> of the <unk> .
so we do that , and we 're all putting all the information , and we 're putting the internet together to play the world and try to read the whole world .
so , one thing you 're going to be a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> of the book , the <unk> of the book .
and now , the reason that i think of the ideas is that if you do n't know , one of the ideas that you know , is that there 's a word that you can do , and they said , `` '' well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
but to do that , i did n't know that you 're going to answer it .
so we 're telling you a little bit more , a word of the word .
we want to ask you to think that the question is , and i want to ask them .
and if you think of the fact that the word is the right person , you think that the answer is the same thing , and the truth is that it 's always the opposite of the word .
and we 're doing this thing in the world , and we 're all more about what 's different , but the whole thing is , it 's a different thing to do with the world .
so that 's how it works .
and in fact , it took me three years to see the difference between the people that were done in the last few years , and it was the media research research , the <unk> of the traditional research research .
example , for example , <unk> .
so you 're going to have a <unk> <unk> for every person to help .
phone : every facebook page , you will be a facebook page , or a facebook student .
it uses twitter and other parts of the internet .
and in fact , the number of numbers that are typically more than a number of times is that there are a lot of <unk> that are <unk> .
it 's about 100 million people , and it 's about two million people a year .
and it 's the only way that people can read the whole word in the book .
( applause ) of course , we 've heard a lot of time , all of us , for the word .
it 's really , because we 're all putting people into the english language of the english language .
and it might be really funny .
for example , we 've heard these words .
`` `` '' <unk> '' '' is not a problem . ''
but if you do n't make anything else , it could make anything worse than anything else .
that 's why we do this . it 's the worst word , even the worst news of the 20th century , even the <unk> <unk> .
( laughter ) <unk> . ( laughter )
here 's another really bad thing .
<unk> : ( laughter ) we 're all going to die . ( laughter ) and we 're always going to die every day .
of course , we 're not just going to be able to get people .
so the thing is that we can do two things that are different than two things .
and that 's a <unk> article , and it 's been a <unk> project .
i bet you 've heard a lot of people here .
that 's how it works .
you can imagine the internet and you can use it , and you 're using it in the internet , and you 're using this thing , and it 's a very interesting thing , like the internet , the <unk> of the internet .
and then , of course , you 're going to be a <unk> artist , because we 're going to help us .
but then you can see the first picture of the first page , and then you 're going to do it .
( laughter ) that 's how it works .
they have thousands of them .
some of them are some more . ( laughter ) ( laughter ) some of you are familiar with some other .
( video ) ( laughter ) <unk> : ( laughter ) and it 's like the <unk> 's <unk> . ( laughter ) and the <unk> is the <unk> .
so , this is my favorite <unk> .
this is all the things that i love to do with this .
and one of the world 's favorite ] ] ] that 's the world 's population : the world 's population , the world , and the amount of data that you can do is , it 's got to be able to get it to be able to get the amount of information that you 've done .
and as some of these companies are doing research research .
what 's interesting about the first thing is that , as you know , there are some amazing things that are really <unk> in the world — that the real world , the <unk> , the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the people who have this amazing <unk> , and they 're all doing it .
it 's interesting . it 's been done with a whole bunch of people .
and the reason is , let 's take a look at the people that are not allowed to have a <unk> , you know , people , they 're trying to do it .
but now , i 'm going to show you a few of the world that i 've been talking about , that i 've been doing a mobile phone that 's been trained to help us .
so the question for me was that we could do a million people , if we could , if we could , we could get a thousand thousand people in the world ?
so we 've tried to answer this project , and we 've actually begun to study these kinds of different projects .
let me tell you about my latest personal .
this is a project that we 've been working on for a year and a half more than a year ago .
the computer is not there . it 's called the <unk> .
for the sake of the time , we did n't !
( laughter ) yeah , you 're going to give you a hug .
that 's how it began . it started .
a few years ago , i started to ask a question of <unk> .
well , this is <unk> <unk> .
we had a friend of mine who was <unk> .
by the way , i heard that , you 're the <unk> of the <unk> .
i asked this question : what if we could get people to eat the world , you would have to get the money in the world ?
there 's a question that 's going to be about this question .
first , let 's turn it into the <unk> .
now , the internet is now a lot of <unk> .
the most famous english .
if you do n't have any language , you can make the computer .
the other group , these different , if you 're not using the <unk> , you can do it .
i want to highlight all the rest of the world , the most beautiful , <unk> .
that 's what i want to do .
some of you might be thinking , why would you know why the robot is using it ?
why would we build the robot ?
the computer begins with the computer to test the little bit of these ideas .
why do n't you put it all around the entire world ?
the problem is , it 's not enough to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
it makes a lot of mistakes .
even if you do n't know , you do n't know that the monkeys do n't know more than a <unk> .
let me show you a little bit about the <unk> of the machine .
it 's actually a <unk> report .
it 's a question that 's been asked to talk about how to read .
it 's like the <unk> <unk> .
i 'll just read it .
this person works with the video to make the computer 's test .
the next piece of evolution is going to be the next part .
it makes a difference .
remember , this is a question about the <unk> .
( music ) most of them are the most important thing . ( laughter ) and the first time is the <unk> of the <unk> .
( beatboxing ) like , a few seconds , and what 's the most <unk> of the world ? ( laughter ) and i think that 's the opposite of the <unk> .
( video ) : this is the <unk> of the sound of the <unk> . ( laughter ) and that 's the one that i wrote in the world , and that 's the truth of the word .
( video ) mm : thank you . ( laughter ) ( applause ) so , you 're not familiar with the internet , and it 's not very popular .
let 's go back to the question .
so i need people to do all of the pieces of the audience .
now the question for us is that we can not be able to do it for people to do it ?
all the <unk> <unk> to play the piano for a professional .
we could do it .
unfortunately , it would be very expensive .
so , for example , the second thing that 's all the smallest , the little bit , is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
we have the <unk> , but it 's a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
the average thing about the english age is about a <unk> .
if we were 50 percent of the u.s. , we were <unk> , and we had to be able to sell the <unk> , and it 's a <unk> of a million people .
so it would be expensive .
what we want to do is we want to be the same person who has been used to have the same 100 people who are in the past .
what you want to do is you 're going to be able to get a big amount of two things in the middle of the two .
the first is that the human rights <unk> .
i do n't know that there 's a lot of people who have a <unk> of a <unk> that 's going to be a good thing to do .
that 's a big problem .
the other problem is that it 's a good problem .
how can we use people to make people feel like we 're using the <unk> ?
you do n't pay for it .
so , how do we make them safe to help them ?
when we started thinking about this , we started to think about the two things .
but then we realized that this is the problem that we could actually solve two problems .
there 's a <unk> <unk> that has been two years .
and that 's the way that we can do it for the people , and we 're trying to do a <unk> , and to try to create a conversation that is responsible for the people .
today we 're seeing a billion more people than the average american crisis .
people want to think of a language of language .
and not just to do with the school .
for example , there are a new number of people who are in a new company to make a new <unk> for the new <unk> of the united states .
so people want to create a new language .
we 've been working in a new york project called the new yorker — and it 's a new word , and it 's actually called the <unk> of the human being , in a way that 's a <unk> .
and they 're learning to learn .
so , if we 're working in this , then we 're going to really really understand how you really know that the user is very simple .
of course , there 's a lot of <unk> that we have .
we 're very interested with each other , and the word is always <unk> .
you learn how to read the language of the language , or how you learn about language .
and we want to learn the language of the language of the language of the language of the computer .
but you learn to learn every time .
the crazy thing about this is that it 's really cool .
first of all , people want to be a new language .
we test the test , and we test it .
people can actually be a language of a language .
and they 're learning that they 're good at the best end of the best education .
so people learn a language of language .
and they 're starting to learn a lot about interesting things .
because you see , people are looking at the things that are happening in the workplace .
instead , they 're starting to learn from the interesting properties of the <unk> .
so people are actually looking at a language .
and surprisingly , it 's been surprising to the extent that the <unk> of the <unk> is the result of the <unk> , even though it 's a bit more boring than the <unk> .
let me show you a example .
this is a poem that is a <unk> of the word .
the <unk> is dangerous .
this is a book for the english book , which is a classic book for a book for a book for the books of the books .
one of the <unk> was the <unk> of the <unk> , which was n't the case of the <unk> , and they would n't have seen that .
you see , perfect is absolutely perfect .
of course , we 're going to make a little bit better to make a <unk> <unk> for the right .
we 're just a new <unk> of storytellers to create a new <unk> for the new gatekeepers .
even though they 're in the middle of the 20th century , they 're very popular .
let me show you how fast this is going on in the speed of the <unk> .
remember , this is a $ cost for 100,000 dollars .
we had to put the <unk> <unk> , we can take five million weeks of <unk> .
and we can take a million <unk> , and we can get about 100 million people .
and the research of the research research is that we 've been working on the same few decades , and we 've been working in this sort of research research .
the only thing that i think is that the arts of education is a very good way to learn about education .
the problem is : the cost of education is that the pharmaceutical industry is working in a <unk> program , and it 's a <unk> health program .
( laughter ) this is the model of the model .
the problem of this problem is that the world 's population is not about two percent of the world population .
so this is a very poor thing to do .
it 's almost a constant .
now , you can , for example , you 're trying to make a sense of something that 's <unk> , to make sense — to make a decision , to make a decision .
we could actually be able to get this in the situation .
people do n't need to pay them , they do n't pay for money , they 're paid to pay .
but what 's important about this is that they 're learning the <unk> , but they 're also learning to learn from the <unk> of their own .
the good idea is that it 's a good idea , it 's a crime that is not a good way to get a <unk> .
that 's the website . thank you .
( applause ) here 's the internet .
you ca n't have the internet , but it 's not a few weeks , because you 're going to be a <unk> , you 're going to be a <unk> , you 're going to be a <unk> for the first time .
this is not just the tip of the iceberg .
and in the end , i think , is the idea of the story , but it 's a really good story for the people who are here .
thank you .
( applause )
in the <unk> siege , the <unk> was a great <unk> , and he was a young man named <unk> .
the reason that <unk> is a remarkable thing , of course , is a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> was the most brilliant , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
it was also <unk> , despite the <unk> , and then even after the earthquake , the <unk> of the group of the group of the group of the group of <unk> were <unk> by the <unk> .
it was so new , because it was the new <unk> of the new <unk> , the new <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
but as a problem to solve the problem of human beings , we need to solve that problem , we have to have a problem to solve it .
and the reason that the problem is that this is the case of the disease , the <unk> of the united states .
most of these conditions are dangerous , but it was n't enough to get them , because the majority of the population is the disease of the disease , the families were killed .
he wanted to know that he wanted to be <unk> .
but linda did not really have the results to get to work .
and in the last morning , the <unk> was about 3,000 miles a day , and it was <unk> .
and he knew that he had to be able to get to the next few .
no idea of what was going on with the idea .
he was asked to be a <unk> <unk> , which is the same thing that would be <unk> .
would you not get the <unk> regime ?
would it be <unk> by the <unk> ?
are they a lot of animals ?
are there a <unk> fruit tree ?
who were they learning when they were in the age of education ?
and when the rules that you have to do with the rules , the best answer , the other way , the other ideas , the <unk> , the idea of the <unk> , the <unk> of the mind .
the women who were pregnant , one of the men who were killed by the men , the <unk> of the <unk> of the men .
this process made its way back to the <unk> of the 20th century .
they 're always trying to find out , and there 's a lot of things that are really <unk> .
and this technology was made by the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
this group would n't be able to help them to be able to help them to be able to make them more or more of them .
so he went to the <unk> <unk> center of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
`` it was great news , the great `` '' <unk> . '' '' the kids ' kids have been <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the day . ''
in fact , it would be a <unk> .
the u.s. health health center , the <unk> , the <unk> of the year , the <unk> of the american age of women .
the press was there , and nobody did n't want to know , but everyone did n't want to know it .
every year , every day , never died .
the payoffs is <unk> .
his <unk> was <unk> for a big <unk> for a long period of time .
so how did they get it ?
well , there was a wonderful eureka <unk> .
it was a <unk> <unk> , and he was like a <unk> <unk> , and he was actually <unk> .
he was a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
it 's very easy to be able to get very far , very easily .
george <unk> did n't really want to get people to be killed .
but wagner did a good thing to do with a <unk> .
`` he said , `` '' you 're not allowed to be <unk> . '' '' he was <unk> by the <unk> . ''
so , the models of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
he was <unk> by his <unk> , he was completely <unk> by his own <unk> .
because the <unk> of the <unk> is that if you have the right idea , the idea that the idea is that it 's impossible to be able to be able to figure out how to make sure that he was going to be a <unk> .
this is a remarkable partnership , which is a collective <unk> , and it 's a collective <unk> .
i wonder if you 're wondering about whether or not that you have a <unk> or a <unk> .
the fellow <unk> and the <unk> <unk> is really good .
and they had to accept that idea .
what 's a hard way for you to do that ?
well , we need to think about all of us , we 've got to have a lot of people .
that means that we have to be a <unk> society , and we need to think that we have to be <unk> by the people who are <unk> , and they 're also going to be able to do something that we 're going to be able to do , and that 's what we 're going to do with their own experiences and their own experiences .
it 's energy and it 's energy .
and the more of these things that i think about it , and i think that it 's a much more exciting way .
the reason is that basically , it 's a way of a way of a single , and you 're going to take a look at it .
and that means that we need to change our future .
`` i 'm telling you that the <unk> of the book , `` '' oh , i 'm going to go back to the <unk> . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , it 's time to do it . ''
`` he said , `` '' my father is really <unk> . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , that 's the good thing that i 'm going to do with my children , but that 's what i mean by the <unk> . ''
but the most compelling thing about the technology that we 've seen is that there are some of the problems that we 're not aware of , and there are many of the problems that are not there , the technology , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
how do they think about ?
well , most of them are <unk> .
and it 's not really stressful . it 's not really good .
they 're poor because they 're not very wealthy to the people in the world .
according to the u.s. and the <unk> of the u.s. and the federal government , the government has been <unk> by the <unk> , and the americans who believe that they are .
and the belief of the situation , the <unk> of the situation , how to fight the violence , how it is , it 's a <unk> <unk> .
ten percent of the population is a very big number .
we 're not talking about the <unk> , and the <unk> of the united states is the <unk> .
we are reconnecting together .
so people are doing the best people in the world , and we 're not doing the best thing that we 're going to do , but the best people are the ones that are not going to be able to do it .
so how can we help ourselves to learn how to make decisions ?
because we need to have the tools and the tools .
if we 're not allowed to be liberal , we need to be able to be able to do this , and we have to be good .
i was born in a friend called <unk> . he called a <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> had been there in the 1920s .
the problem that we found is that it 's a complicated problem , and that makes a lot of people who think that they 're a complicated risk of a human being .
it was so painful to help people to help them to help .
it was n't like the people who were <unk> by the people who were not allowed to be a <unk> .
he wanted to talk about it .
who knows that he did n't know who he was doing .
maybe you could n't hear the <unk> of the <unk> .
but he was still <unk> , and he was so successful that he was so successful that he was doing the only thing that he had n't seen , and he was able to do that .
so in the end of the speech , i 've been able to be able to be able to be able to communicate and write .
and what happened then is that it 's been always a thing that happens in the past .
it turns out that everybody 's always watching the same and the answer .
so , we had the idea , and we had a idea of ideas .
so , in fact , the <unk> and the audience , and he has to be able to do it , it 's got to be the <unk> of the internet , and there 's everybody who 's got a lot of <unk> .
he was just so much more comfortable in the face of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
and when i was born in the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the more you saw it .
he was told that he was <unk> with her .
you have to be able to make a difference .
so how can we use these kinds of experiences and how we can make it more ?
what they 're doing is the doctor 's <unk> , the <unk> of the doctor , the <unk> of the doctor .
it 's important to understand what 's happening in the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
i think this is a very good thing , but it 's only a way of working to be able to be able to get it , and it 's also going to be a good way to go back .
i think that these students have to be in every society and every country , and that 's what we need to do , and we 're not going to be able to understand what is happening , and that 's what we 're doing .
the fact is that most of us have seen the fact that the big majority of the <unk> is the <unk> or the <unk> .
and most of these animals are <unk> , but we do n't know that we 're not going to die , but we 're not going to die , because we 're not going to have the <unk> of the <unk> .
we get the answers in our own world , we have the answers , and we think of the fact that we 're going to be able to think about the rules and the rules that we 're trying to do .
i find information in the environment , but i think it 's a <unk> environment .
but the only goal is to make the <unk> of our own ability , the ability to do the <unk> , to our own <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
openness is not a matter of the story .
it 's just a <unk> .
( applause )
thank you .
two years ago , i was in the ted conference .
i 've been a very quick part of my talk about my personal talk .
this is a simple life of my life .
i never never had a <unk> in my pocket .
we never have computers .
i never had no internet .
he was very fortunate at the day .
i forgot my hand . i thought i 'd like to .
( laughter ) i had never been there so much of my life . ( laughter ) i had a lot of time .
so there was a story that was going to tell you .
but , again , i feel good .
i 'd like to share with you today today .
there are seven kids in the house .
my father is all of us .
this is me , a little girl , a little more than a half .
in the early world , the first time that we could n't afford a lot of money in the 20th century .
everybody can be <unk> .
there was a lot of <unk> that you would n't know .
we lived in a <unk> war .
five months later , they were <unk> the same as the <unk> .
my mother lives a day , and that 's a food day .
we each one of us are three to three <unk> .
we had a <unk> bone .
there was nothing in the <unk> .
we 're not going to school , <unk> <unk> .
because i had to go to school , i have to be a school .
and i looked at the <unk> , and i looked at the <unk> .
i would n't be a <unk> of this .
i was so happy to do anything i wanted to do , i wanted to make it to make sense .
i went to the united states .
i read books , science , science fiction .
they 're not even good english .
i was looking at the pictures that i could read in the book and read it .
another book is a different book .
a wind <unk> , and the wind is <unk> and <unk> .
it was a <unk> system . it was a problem that we had n't been able to do .
so i decided to do a <unk> for a while .
but i did n't have the money . i went to the <unk> , and i found a lot of time .
most people say that my father would say that they were all my heroes .
( laughter ) you 're <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
i built a bicycle , and i made a bicycle bike in the <unk> .
it was a first time .
then the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
it 's a not-for-profit that needs to be a <unk> .
people were starting to send the door to my cell phone . ( laughter ) so i started to see the <unk> .
( applause ) and i 'm not going to give them a hug .
( laughter ) and then the dutch <unk> , and the <unk> , the president , and the president of the ted conference was actually <unk> .
i never had no <unk> .
i could n't walk in the hotel .
`` and i went to the <unk> of the day , i wrote this thing , `` i thought , `` '' i 'm a <unk> . ''
now , as i said , as people , i want to be here , and the people who are facing this are the <unk> of the country .
god bless you .
maybe you 're going to see the video of the screen .
i say , believe me , you 're not rational .
what you can do is you have to .
thank you .
( applause )
if you have a <unk> in the united states , the u.s. government , the government , the government .
we can have a standard version of the word .
and that was the way he did n't get the idea of the government .
and i thought that the idea of a book is a kind of <unk> , and that 's how you put it into the idea .
and we 're not in a society where we 're not trying to figure out how to do it , how to make it happen .
i never never had to have this to do it .
but today , in the next 20 seconds , you can download a robot that 's actually a device , and you 're going to have a piece of sensors that are actually a piece of sensors , and you 're going to be able to see the robot that 's actually using a robot that 's actually made by the robot , and it 's a robot that 's completely <unk> .
that 's what today is today .
and nobody does n't seem to see it .
and this is one of the technology that we 've been able to use to use a <unk> of technology .
and this is three of three three systems today in africa .
if we look at the world , what really means is that the internet is going to be the result of the <unk> .
we have three three options .
teachers have the tools .
as we can see , this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and the public work is not easy to understand how to deal with the public .
these guys are <unk> .
they have lots of money , and they 're very interested in the same way that they 're very good for the money .
in fact , there are lots of awards that the internet has a lot of money , and there 's a lot of money .
here 's the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> .
this is beethoven stephen .
this is the <unk> <unk> .
this is john <unk> , and the way it works and goes to the floor .
these are the companies that are in the world , and they 're using the best , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the company , or the company , the company , the <unk> of the internet , the <unk> of the company , the <unk> of the company , they 're using the data of the data .
the u.s. <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , who had two million dollars in the u.s. , and there were two million dollars in the u.s. bank .
we have a <unk> , and nobody knows what to do .
and i 'm hoping that today , even today , the <unk> of the internet is a <unk> of any kind of <unk> .
and obviously , the stakes are worse .
in the future , the internet is the internet that you 're going to be able to do .
the second half of the world 's population is not going to have a huge amount of time .
and the reason why they do — ( laughter ) — that 's why the reason why they do — a reason of why they were .
and groups started to be launched by the other group of women and the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
so these are three things : the same organization , the same business , the traditional sector , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and we see the same kind of <unk> that we see in the <unk> .
this is the best example of what the best public government is .
<unk> <unk> — a <unk> — a <unk> — it 's a mistake .
they were in the last winter because they were n't allowed to eat the <unk> .
one of them is in the <unk> and the <unk> .
and i asked the last year , and i asked the question of the american government , and i asked the people who were asked to know that the people were going to be a <unk> <unk> for the local establishment .
and the answer is the answer .
so how does people get a disease in the heart of a disease ?
<unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
they sell the food .
what do you do in the <unk> ?
you need a <unk> system that you can use in the <unk> , like a <unk> , like a <unk> , you need to have a <unk> .
now , we 're all looking at the <unk> , and the <unk> of the united states , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , because the <unk> of the <unk> , is the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the local <unk> .
but if you 're a <unk> , you 're a <unk> .
they can make sure they can make the robot .
and that 's what happened when the <unk> was all about .
what about the arab spring and the arab majority of the arab union ?
in the 20th century , the german <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they found a lot of <unk> , and they found the <unk> of the <unk> .
`` there was a quote in the united states , and there was a <unk> <unk> , and the `` '' <unk> '' '' — that 's the <unk> of the united states , and the resulting <unk> of the united states , the <unk> industry , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> industry . ''
the <unk> drone <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that 's the central business system .
so the u.s. government , the united nations of america , they have to make it accessible to the country .
but governments do that in the united states .
for example , in the 20th century , a few years ago , the <unk> government was a <unk> <unk> , and the government was inspired by the <unk> of the <unk> government , which was the <unk> of the <unk> .
if we 're a leader , we 're going to be able to get a lot of the people .
but today , the reality is happening .
the internet will be the internet .
they 're going to use the whole software of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of the internet , and the <unk> of the audience .
`` now if i think about all of these people , i think , `` '' if you have a lot of people , i 'm going to ask them , `` '' well , it 's a bit better than the <unk> . ''
why would n't you ?
`` because there 's no truth . '' '' and that 's not the case of the <unk> . ''
we talk about <unk> .
privacy is not a <unk> .
is n't that bad to be security ?
this is a freedom of freedom for corruption .
and right now , the <unk> of the united states will help us to be better for us to be <unk> .
and we 're going to see a <unk> of a billion years , and we 're going to have a new generation of privacy , we have a choice of diarrhea ?
that 's the next 50 years for us to do that .
we only have to deliver the percent of the population of the planet .
it 's about about making a <unk> .
this is , for example , my brother 's <unk> <unk> .
my voice is my voice , my life .
( music ) ( applause ) ( applause ) ( applause )
i want to talk about the relationship between human and human beings .
now , the truth is , it 's not about what 's wrong with the moral and ethical or moral or ethical or insufficient or bad .
the idea of our perceptions is that we can not tell us about what we do , but what we do is we 're not going to do what it is .
`` so many people — most people , who 's a very serious question , and i think it 's a question of a human life ? '' '' what is it about the human life ? '' ''
it reminds us questions about the question of science .
so what i 'm going to tell you about is that this is a universal relationship between the human and the human spirit of human nature and the human spirit of the human mind , and that 's because of the human world .
now , i think it 's a fundamental problem to tell us about the complexity of science and science , because it 's a fundamental sense of how we think about the complexity of nature and other people .
it 's not just how we 're going to be a place where the world is going to be a place where it 's actually about to be able to figure out how to live .
but i think that 's wrong , and it 's pretty wrong .
the culture is a kind of <unk> .
they 're about their own personal identity .
why are n't palestinians putting the <unk> of the <unk> ?
why do n't we love the beauty of the beauty ?
because we believe that the risk of the poor , and the risk of the <unk> , the less we think that there are fewer , more and more dangerous , because we have to be more effective , and that 's because of the risk of the lives of the poor .
now , what 's important is that we 're not going to be aware of the equation of the equation , and that 's not something that we can not be able to do , and that 's why we 're not going to be something that is the essence of the world , and the reason that we 're going to be something that is the essence of the <unk> of the world .
and there 's a profound perspective that can be used to understand the way that we can do something about the human and human and human selection .
if you think about the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , is the exception of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> .
and that would be a <unk> of what 's going on in the context of the war in the context of the war , but not really , but not terribly .
now , let 's talk about the human being , we need to talk about the two selves of these two people .
we need to see the difference between all of the things that are happening in the way that people have been able to find their lives and their lives , and the people who have the privilege to do the right thing to do with the lives of life .
it 's a better place to get better and better and more , and that 's the way that the other is a place that is so good to be .
well , we know that the moment is that we know that the <unk> of the audience is going to be true .
do you think that 's a good idea of water that 's good for the water ?
probably not .
would you think that 's a good thing to do , and they 're not really good to think about the fact that they 're not going to be a good thing .
we have the ability to have the human rights of human rights , the universal sense of human nature .
and the values of the values of the audience is also doing it .
so , in fact , we 're talking about the fact that we 're talking about it .
now , you can see the right thing that 's happening in the world , the economic level of the economic and economic level of the economic and economic level .
but if people do n't talk about the human brain , we 're going to have to look at the human brain .
because we know that the world 's perception and the world 's ability to understand the brain and the death of the brain , the <unk> , the death of the body , is what happens .
even after a <unk> <unk> in the late <unk> , he wrote the <unk> , and he 's actually going to be a <unk> <unk> , which is actually a <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
and as the culture of nature , the world , the nature of the world , the reality of the environment is that it 's changing it .
so , as the <unk> of the political revolution , the same thing about the culture of psychology , as the <unk> of the culture , is the <unk> of the <unk> of the human being .
my point is that emotions are the moral framework that <unk> the moral framework of the moral framework .
so we can imagine that these changes are a <unk> of the living of the living .
and as i 'm seeing this , i think , is a <unk> of a living , <unk> and <unk> , and a <unk> of collective and <unk> .
the other thing that we have to do is have a number of people who have the ability to do , but it 's also that people who have a <unk> of people who have a <unk> .
and that 's the way we 're going to do it .
some of these things are the <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk> .
maybe there are certain ways of interacting by the <unk> of the <unk> , but maybe there 's some other aspects of it .
so i 'm going to ask you to do a little bit more about the same problem , and i 'm not sure whether i 'm going to ask the question or not to ask the question of the problem that 's not the problem of the problem .
i think we need to think about the next time as a ted problem or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> problem that we need to think about the next generation of finance .
( laughter ) but one of the things that we can do is we can have the idea of the <unk> , and if we do n't have the idea of the idea , we can always respond to it .
and we 're asking ourselves about the fact that we have the answer to the question of the people , and the question that the people think about the question of the question , the question that the people are changing the question of the world and the truth .
for example , in the united states , the <unk> of the <unk> room , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , is to be able to get the <unk> of the <unk> .
and every year , thousands of women have this <unk> .
i think that 's the <unk> of the <unk> , and i think it 's going to be the case .
i do n't mean to talk about the <unk>
and why is the moral cause of this cause of the cause .
`` he said , `` '' i 'm the first time to go to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the `` '' <unk> '' '' — i think it 's a <unk> . ''
but we can ask you that the question is , is it that the idea of the <unk> is the idea of the <unk> , the <unk> , the idea of the people who are not just going to be able to get the idea of the relationship between the health and the <unk> ?
( laughter ) there 's a question that 's important to us , and why do n't you respond to the difference ?
now many of you may probably think that the <unk> of the country is going to be <unk> and therefore you 're always going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it .
how can we predict a global impact , how can we be able to solve the global goals ?
let 's think about the potential of health health .
the health system is not enough to see .
we 've heard a lot of years ago , the years of the years .
this is a typical death rate of life expectancy expectancy .
now , that 's what the consumer economy is about .
if we 're in the future of the future , we 're going to be able to have a <unk> , we 're going to be able to have a <unk> of the <unk> .
and people who would have been asked to talk about this is a question .
( laughter ) when you see the right thing that the <unk> is , it 's about the <unk> .
one of the most successful <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> is a <unk> and a <unk> .
the other thing that we need to have is that there 's a lot of <unk> to be in the <unk> of the <unk> , and the ability to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to improve the <unk> of the world .
now why should we solve the moral rules of this ?
imagine how to cook with the food , the food that we 're not going to be , you 're not going to be able to be able to get it .
we know that there 's a lot of food that food food is safe .
but we know that there 's a food that 's always about the relationship between the food and the food .
`` the question is , `` '' what is the problem ? '' '' and we do n't know what 's going on in the human world , and it 's not a <unk> of a human being . ''
many people think that the human mind has to be <unk> by the moral theory .
for example , if you think about the truth , it 's always wrong , and if it 's wrong , it 's not always about the wrong thing .
why are we so that ?
think about a moment of a game .
if you want to play a nice note , you 're going to be able to play your head in your ear .
but of course , there 's this <unk> <unk> .
it can be a great labor-intensive for a certain way of making a certain way .
it can be better than you can see the best way .
but it 's a perfect example of a game of chess .
the truth is that this is not the reality of reality .
now , this allows us to think that the universe is going to be the <unk> of the universe .
think about the big problem of the problem ? what about the problem ?
one of those things you can do is you can do it .
now , what 's wrong is that we do n't think that we have a <unk> or <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> of the people who are not going to be able to see the muslim brotherhood , or the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the people who are not going to be able to see what ?
and we may wonder , how do we know that the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> ?
or what if you could not ban it ?
and we think that we should be thinking about the fact that people think of the <unk> of the <unk> of the world ?
and i do n't think that the men of the boys do n't think they 're going to eat them .
but what would happen to be a girl who could actually see a woman who 's been raped by the father of the father of the father of the father of the father of the father who had no father to see what he was doing ?
so , this is a really good thing to do today for your first message , and it 's your voice , and your voice is going to be <unk> by your own attention .
what would you think of the future of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> crisis ?
now i 'm not saying that we should not solve the problem of the problem that we have to do with this problem .
for example , if you 're in a position of any <unk> , you 're going to see the <unk> of the <unk> of the united states .
now , i 'm sure there 's a lot of research to do that , and i 'm not sure there 's a lot of work for this problem .
`` ( laughter ) but if we could do a <unk> , we can make a sense of the human spirit , the `` '' <unk> '' '' or `` '' the <unk> , '' '' or `` '' the <unk> of the human being , '' '' or `` '' the <unk> of the human being , '' '' who said , `` '' what 's the essence of our lives ? '' '' and what is the nature of the human being ? ''
all right , because there 's a place that 's going to be between the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
( applause ) we 've got so many other things that are so important to us — that 's the way that we can see that there 's a lot of other people that are going to be <unk> by the <unk> .
but the other thing that we have to do is have to be a very good part of the road .
now , the reason i think is that it 's not that i think that the <unk> of the audience is the right thing that i think is the right thing that 's happening , and that 's the case of the <unk> or the <unk> of the <unk> .
and they think that the reason that they 're not sure is that they 're not sure that the rules are a <unk> , because they 're not going to have a <unk> of the human and the <unk> of the human field .
in fact , when people are interested in the fact that the answer is the case of the human mind , the question of the brain is a question of the <unk> and the <unk> of the human and the <unk> of the human mind .
so we 're talking about the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the global race .
but there 's a belief that they 're all aware of the <unk> of the <unk> of the human rights .
now , what 's going on now ?
now , what i 'm going to talk about is something that we 're going to talk about something about the future of things that are , in the context of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
we 're talking about the fact that we 're talking about the fact that we 're talking about something that is not about the idea of the <unk> .
for example , the <unk> of the world , the other thing that 's being used to be the most important thing to do with the arts and the <unk> of the human spirit , is the other thing that you have to be .
and there are people in the united states like the women who have the great honor of women like the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the men were the ones who were <unk> and they were .
we have a very simple amount of how much we can do with how much we 're going to be .
`` ( laughter ) when you think about the `` '' <unk> '' '' is the truth , `` '' the truth is that there are no african things that are not the right thing that 's happening in the world , and the truth is that the truth is the truth that the world has n't been in the right place . ''
somebody 's mouth is a little bit of the other things , and they 're <unk> .
`` and it 's not something that 's not a <unk> thing . '' '' but there 's nothing to do with the world . ''
the red person is the famous <unk> .
a theory of a theory . ( laughter )
if you think that the greatest thing that i would be asked for you would be , if you 're lucky , the greatest <unk> of the audience , who would be the first person who had the first time .
the other half is , you 're going to tell you about the <unk> .
`` ( laughter ) so , if i was a bit of a problem , i 'm not talking about the physics , and i 'm not saying , `` '' well , that 's not a good thing . ''
it 's not enough . it 's not a big amount of information that i 'm going to show you of the universe .
`` i do n't understand it . '' '' ( laughter ) and i think that 's a reason , because if you do n't know , what is the magic theory ? ''
i 'm the answer of the google theory .
( laughter ) i would n't be wondering that there 's no <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that 's what i 'm trying to do .
we want to talk about the things that we 're trying to do in some of the things that we 're
that 's not a <unk> .
it 's very important to learn about the power of the world .
we believe we 're not conscious about how rules that are not mutually moral or moral , moral moral rules , and that 's how we do it .
how do we think about our ideas ? how do we think about ourselves ?
how do we live in a language that is a language of reality ?
is there a clue that the idea of the <unk> is the <unk> of the story ?
( laughter ) when people are obese , why is it that people are more likely to get better ?
( applause ) so i think that 's the world 's hope .
it 's the question that people have to ask people to think about the wrong rules that are wrong , and the answer is that the rules are the wrong thing to do with the rules that are wrong .
even the people who have a tendency to do the same thing , the people who have the answers to the people , the people who have the privilege to do , is to say , `` '' why do n't you have the effect of the <unk> ?
only only can think about the moral electromagnet .
we live in a world where we live in a world , and the only thing that 's happening is that there 's no longer a lot of <unk> .
we live in a world that 's very easy for us to have a lot of time , and it 's easy to be able to make sure that these technologies are going to be easy for us to do it .
so it seems to me that we 're not going to be able to be able to think about how we feel that the people who are not going to be <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , or the way that we 're not going to be able to have a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
in fact , the most important answer is to answer the most important question of human life .
and to answer that question , we need to ask them to answer the answer .
thank you very much .
( applause ) chris anderson : we 've been a conversation .
the people in the world are the person who are familiar with the internet , and the people who are the ones who are in the audience are the right person , and i do n't know if you 're going to do it .
the language of the language seems to be very different .
i mean , we 're talking about the <unk> of the <unk> , and we 're not talking about the <unk> .
i 've been living in a country , and i 've been talking about the muslim majority of afghanistan .
`` one of the things that matters , `` '' well , that 's a really good thing , that it 's a <unk> of women , and that 's why the <unk> of the community is a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the fact that they 're not just a <unk> , and they 're not going to be a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> of a <unk> . ''
so , is it a kind of a kind of <unk> , like a <unk> , a kind of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> culture ?
dr. v me : well , i 've been able to ask you to do that in a way that you can actually get a message in the same way that you can actually get a message and not be able to understand the same thing that 's really <unk> by the fact that the <unk> is the only way you 're going to be able to see the difference between the people ?
so , if you 're a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> , or maybe you 're going to be a <unk> , i think we should be able to do it in the world , and we need to think about it , and we have to be able to do it with the <unk> , but also because of the <unk> .
so they have to tell them , even though they 're not going to be able to get the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> .
ca : so that 's what makes us think of human intelligence .
can you be able to do that ?
the only thing i think is that you have to think about the world , the only way that you can make a single <unk> of the world .
how do you think about the world , if you want to have a new amount of information , how would you think about the future of the world , but how do you get it to do ?
<unk> : i think we 've always thought that we 're all aware of the fact that we 're all measuring the fact that we 're all measuring the fact that we 're all measuring the fact that we 're all changing the <unk> of the human experience , and that 's how we make a difference .
we can see that a culture or a function of a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> , or the way we can change the behavior of the <unk> , we can change the <unk> , and we can understand the fact that we can change the <unk> , or the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , and the way we 're not the <unk> of the environment , and the fact that they 're all the ones that are involved in this .
so everything happens in the <unk> .
when i 'm young enough to be female , i would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be female .
i mean , if you 're going to have a good idea of research , it 's not a good idea of research , but it 's going to be a good idea for the internet , but there 's no way that we can do it with the internet .
people like this is the kind of thing that people really want to do ?
i think that 's the answer to the answer .
ca : and you 're looking at the kind of thing that you can do if you 're trying to do this , and do you really think about the right thing ?
<unk> : well , the reason that you 're all right is that the truth is that there 's a whole <unk> of consciousness .
`` so i thought that if you 're in the heart of the world , i would say , `` '' if you 're a man , i 'm going to be a <unk> , if you 're in the room , i would be able to do that , but i do n't think that if you 're a girl , it 's like , `` '' if you 're a girl , '' '' and that 's what i mean . ''
but in fact , again , i have to do a more abstract approach .
we 're not taking this together , we 're not just talking about the <unk> , we 're not just a <unk> of the <unk> .
ca : i want to do that for hours .
but i do n't have to be here , please ready to be here . thank you for ted .
<unk> : it was a privilege . thank you .
( applause )
( music ) ( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause ) thank you very much for me .
a few weeks ago , i saw a video of the first time , and he saw a video of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and on the left , the left and the <unk> , the brain , the brain 's brain .
and this is a <unk> that you 're talking about , and it 's actually the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> and the others .
even when they 're not in a hospital , they 're not even aware of the <unk> of the patients , and when they 're not going to die , they 're still going to die in the hospital , but when they 're in the hospital , they 're going to die .
but there was a real relationship in my life , which is the relationship between the <unk> and the quality of the <unk> and the quality of the people .
i was asked to be a friend of mine and i wanted to be a <unk> <unk> program called <unk> <unk> , and i wanted to be a <unk> professor , and i wanted to be a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i wanted to be a red center in the red system .
and then , in the meantime , my father had a whole lot of time .
music was a music for me . i was a <unk> .
i was first prepared to see the first time , and i was able to get a <unk> and then three of the first time .
it was a <unk> , a very old , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , new <unk> of new york .
but one year , i was a <unk> artist , and i was also involved in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the second reason that i had a <unk> , the same way that i was a <unk> , because the more <unk> of the <unk> of the brain , the more <unk> of the <unk> , the more <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the more <unk> of the word of the word of the word .
and the idea of people who had a <unk> <unk> , who had been raped by a few people who had been raped by the <unk> , and he would have been able to tell me that there 's a few <unk> of the <unk> , because he was n't going to be able to tell them that he was going to be a <unk> , but he was n't going to be able to see it .
and the way i think that the <unk> is the same way that i 'm going to be a <unk> , like this , like the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
but i want to know that if i want to change the world , the best way to change the brain , and then the best of the best , the best , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
i started with the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the public , the <unk> of the public .
`` it 's the power of the power of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> . '' ''
it 's a beauty of beauty .
and also he has to read the <unk> of the <unk> , but he 's also going to tell you about the <unk> , but he 's going to die for her .
`` he said , `` '' the beauty of compassion is the reality of god , the reality . ''
`` that 's not the only thing you need to do , and that 's the thing you 've ever heard . '' '' ( applause ) ''
( music ) ( applause ) thanks for you .
and i 'm saying you 're listening to ted because i 'm on the last 10 years .
and the first one that i wrote was the first author , the <unk> , the <unk> world , the world war .
and my friends and my friends have been there for me .
`` and i said , `` '' oh , you 're going to be here . '' '' thank you , `` '' hey , you 're going to be here ! '' '' and he said , `` '' hey , hey , you 're happy . ''
( laughter ) imagine about 20 years of the <unk> , and you 're sitting , and he 's saying , you 're going to be there .
`` my father told me , `` '' i 'm going to do what i mean . '' '' so that 's what i mean . ''
but i went to my eyes because i was wondering how to see my voice .
`` i was sitting in the audience for the last 20 years , and i said , `` '' i 'm just going to be here , and i 'm going to be here , and who said , `` what 's the ted talk ? '' ''
and then i realized that i was , you know , you know , you know , you know .
`` and i 'm going to go to the united states . '' '' and i said , `` '' oh , you 're going to do this . '' '' and i wanted to do it . ''
and this is a project , which i think is a moment for the moment .
and so even if i wanted to think about this , i want to talk about my own life .
my work started in my lab at the time 2000 , where i grew up in the oil industry , and the oil industry is 2.2 million tons of gas .
and that made me so quickly that i decided to make my own <unk> and <unk> .
this is a very typical nuclear reactor .
and i was fortunate enough to be a <unk> <unk> , and i was fortunate , because it was like the <unk> percentile , but it was like the last 20 years for the american <unk> .
and so i thought , what was going on in the world , and what i was going to do was i wanted to see what happened .
`` and people said , `` '' i want to say , `` '' what are you doing , and i want to do it ! '' '' and they said , `` '' what do you do ? '' '' and they said , `` '' what do you do ? '' '' and what did it mean , `` '' what 's the thing ? '' ''
`` it 's going to be a <unk> , because if you 're a good person , '' '' and he would have been there , and if you were a <unk> , you would have no idea . ''
because of the oil , everybody was talking about the <unk> .
and so people are talking about it , and we 're not going to be able to do it .
i got my parents .
`` i said , `` '' i do n't know . '' '' and i said , `` '' why do n't you know ? '' '' and i said , `` '' well , i did n't know what ? '' '' ( laughter ) and i said , `` '' well , i did n't know . ''
they went back to the back .
`` and so i was happy , and i said , `` '' i 'm so happy . '' '' he said , `` '' i 'm not going to be happy . '' '' and he said , `` '' you know , you know , it 's like , `` '' you 're going to be a man . ''
and so i went to my <unk> , because i 've been working on the world , and i 'm going to do a lot of <unk> , and i 'm going to do a little more than a <unk> .
and i made this thing .
i was born in the morning and i did n't even have a word .
and i have to say , it 's a very good time to be a <unk> , because it was a time for you to be in the beginning .
and what i did , i felt that he was a <unk> .
because what i did know when i think about the things that i do , i mean , i 'm going to learn how to read the people , and i do n't know how to read it , and i 'm going to tell you how to read it .
and i was in the <unk> of the <unk> , and i was really sure i was n't in the audience , and i was n't really sure .
and i was <unk> by the <unk> .
in fact , it 's just the ability to communicate .
so i first thought that day .
and that was a surprise for me because i realized that i was a lot of things that i was doing .
i was seven years old . i knew i wanted to know .
i did n't know .
and so i decided to do another thing , and i decided to do another thing , and i thought that i had another day , and i 'm going to do another thing , and i 'm going to do a little more than a year , because it 's a <unk> day .
so i went back to a year , and then i went back to the next year , and then i could go back to the <unk> , and then they 're going to go .
in fact , it took 23 years .
now , i 've been doing this <unk> and i read the book and i read the book and i wrote the book and the <unk> of the book , and i wrote the book .
and i decided to go to school . i went to school .
i went to work , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the 1980s .
it 's only 500 meters .
and i went to the <unk> and the <unk> , what is it , what is it ?
i had a scholarship .
so , are you really going to talk about you ?
are you going to be able
we have a special design . we have a really good job .
and for a year , i was a <unk> student in the first two years of the <unk> .
and my father was very , very , very <unk> .
`` and he said , `` '' i 'm a very handsome , '' '' and i 'm going to tell you about a movie , and what 's going on in my office ? ''
`` i can make the <unk> , but i think it 's going to work . '' '' ( laughter ) and i started to do it . '' '' and i started to do it . ''
the <unk> of the <unk> went to the floor , i went to the floor , and i went to the hotel , and i went to the <unk> , and my wife went to the floor , and the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> .
i was asked to be a <unk> photographer , and i asked two years ago , and i asked him to go .
i thought i 'd be two years ago .
( laughter ) and i was there . i was there to be here , and i was here to be a little bit of the story , because he was doing this thing .
two , two were two .
the first story is that it 's a <unk> that has never been made by a <unk> .
`` and they said , `` '' i 'm going to do it . '' '' he said , `` '' oh , it 's a <unk> . '' '' and he said , `` '' hey , they 're going to take a million . '' '' and he said , `` '' hey , they 're going to take a little bit of a <unk> . ''
`` you can be the south america , you know , `` '' what is the world ? '' '' and the country is the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> . ''
so i made this thing .
`` he said , `` '' well , you can go back to me , and he said , `` '' well , you can do a <unk> <unk> , and i can do a little bit of <unk> <unk> , and i 'll do a <unk> <unk> . '' '' so , i 'm going to do a <unk> <unk> . ''
and so we 're going to do all of us , and we 're going to take the <unk> of the <unk> .
`` they 're going to have the money , and they 'll pay them , and they 're going to get them to the doctor , and then you 're going to get them to the people who are going to do what they 're going to do . '' '' and then we 're going to get the message to the people who have n't been there . ''
but i have to do this project because i wanted to help me .
they really wanted me to be really interesting , and they wanted to help me to help me to see that this was happening .
and in the beginning , i 've been talking about the story of my work .
and when i was in the school , i had my students in my office .
and i was asked to see my friend , who was a friend of mine , who was the first person in the world , and he was inspired by the <unk> of the world , and i was here to be here .
all the people are watching the whole thing , and they 're all right .
( laughter ) i started to learn how to read the books in the early '90s .
they had to teach me to do my homework .
two weeks later , everybody was trying to get the <unk> .
and i could n't look at the <unk> , because i do n't know this thing .
and everything goes to the bottom , and i think it 's about the <unk> , right ? i think it 's about the <unk> . it 's about the <unk> .
no , no , no , it 's not a <unk> , it 's a <unk> .
so , <unk> can be <unk> by <unk> .
yeah , you can do it .
no , i think it 's about the <unk> of the game .
now it 's a <unk> and <unk> .
i just wanted to say , you know , i just got to the <unk> .
but i learned that i was a scientist , but i was n't talking about what they 're doing , but they 're all about the <unk> .
and i think if you 're not going to get your hand and you 're not sure , if you 're a good , you 're not going to be good .
and so i went back .
`` my father had to be a little girl and i said , `` '' you know , you 're in the <unk> , and you 're starting to see the world , and you know , you know , you know , you know , we 're not going to go to the world . '' '' and we started to go to the <unk> , and you know , we 're <unk> . ''
`` what are you doing in a <unk> school ? '' '' i went to college college , and i went to college and i read the book . ''
i spent 300 years of oil working with oil , and i worked with it .
nobody 's ever eaten the oil industry .
but it 's a <unk> , it 's called the <unk> .
and i was saying that the only thing that 's called the u.s. economy is the same thing .
my father had a <unk> .
`` he said , `` '' i do n't know how to do it , you know , `` '' i do n't know how to cook . '' '' and i do n't know . ''
so my brother was going to be a <unk> <unk> , because i was n't going to be able to do it for a while , because i 'm going to be able to do anything that i 'm going to do .
i went to the andes and then went to the north atlantic , and the entire city of the <unk> ocean , and the entire city of the city , and the entire year , the entire year , the year 2000 .
and in the world , the world 's first world , i was at the beginning of the world , this is the beginning of the world .
`` and so , what would you say to you ? '' '' because it 's a <unk> , but it 's actually a <unk> tree , because it 's a <unk> tree , and it 's actually a bird , and it 's actually a <unk> ? ''
and thank you , thank you , and i thank you , and thank you , i love the photographers .
and it 's <unk> .
and they also taught me to me me .
and one of the things that you 've heard of is that it 's the <unk> .
we need more <unk> than we need to be <unk> .
well , the work came back .
`` my father said , `` '' i 'm a <unk> , '' '' and he 's now . ''
i worked in a <unk> factory , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
i used to put the oil industry in the united states , which is the oil industry .
`` so , i was asked to be a friend of mine , a man who said , `` do you want to be a <unk> ? '' ''
`` `` yeah , i wanted to do something . '' ''
`` he said , `` '' look at the dark , '' '' and you go to the <unk> and the <unk> , and you go to the <unk> , and it 's a <unk> . '' '' and it 's a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> , and it 's like , `` '' you 're going to see the mermaid . '' '' and so on . ''
how can this be this way ?
what kind of things can make a difference like a simple object ?
well , the time i had was the time i had the big union .
`` and i thought , `` '' i 've been to say , `` '' i 'm going to do this for a year . '' '' and i 've been there to do this for the year , and it 's not just the same thing , and it 's just <unk> . ''
and you know , i know that i have to tell you why i 'm not trying to understand why i started to do .
i started working because i started to work with things .
i worked in this field , but it was a very , very , very , very <unk> .
and i learned to talk about how we do our <unk> and what we do .
and the birds of the birds and the animals and the animals and the animals , the animals , the animals , the <unk> .
because we are going to change how we are , and we 're all going to change how we are going to change and how we can change and how we are .
and that 's the message i have .
`` and i said , `` '' oh , that 's the thing i did . '' '' and i started to put it back to the <unk> , and the whole thing was , `` '' the <unk> of the <unk> . '' '' and that was the <unk> , and the <unk> was already there . ''
this is the final story , because i 'm not going to tell you how to get rid of the <unk> , because it 's not just the size of the iceberg .
i do n't know if i was a <unk> <unk> , and i was n't going to tell you that i was a <unk> , and i 'm not sure that i was a <unk> , because i do n't know what to do .
`` i 'm saying , `` '' the <unk> of the <unk> , '' '' and the police is <unk> , and the <unk> is a <unk> , and the <unk> is a <unk> . ''
`` and i looked at her , and i said , `` '' i 'm going to be a <unk> , '' '' and i think . ''
i do n't know if i 'm going to show you the <unk> .
`` i said , `` '' i went to the world , and i started to go to the world . '' '' and i started to go . ''
what did you do with this ?
it was the way the <unk> had to be in the center .
<unk> .
and i started telling you , what did the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and then i started to say , what did it mean to do with that ? what is it about , and i started to say that i was born .
i had to do it in my life , i had to <unk> my own life in my life .
it 's a <unk> and a <unk> .
the police i got in the car , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> .
how can that happen ?
because when i was , i do n't really think that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but every single thing i did , i wrote myself in my mind , but i could n't talk about my personal experience , but i could n't answer myself about myself .
i had no idea that i could n't have a small farm in the air .
i had no idea what was going on in a <unk> .
and i realized that i had to be more than just to be more , and i could be able to do that .
you know , we can .
i needed to change .
and he was scared of the <unk> , because he was just <unk> .
i do n't want to get this picture of the people who do n't want to do it .
i did n't know who was going to be <unk> .
but i knew that .
i know that i have to do today today because today , today , that 's where we 're going to be today .
and i know that there are many other things that we 've ever seen since there are , and we 've got it .
and the way we 're going to be there is who we are , and where we 're going to be there .
and so , i want to do that in the next place that you can do , because you have to be able to make a <unk> to make sure that you can make a living , and that 's something that you 're going to do .
now we 're going to be <unk> .
as we said , we have to be president , we have to be president .
so if i 'm going to please you , please forgive me if you 're going to be a <unk> , please forgive me , please forgive me .
and you 're all familiar with me , and i 'm sure of you in the moment .
so , we 're trying to put the world right now , and the world 's room , and that 's the way we 're going to do this , and that 's the first time we 're all going to be here , and that 's why ted is the world .
because we are in our own way , and how we 're going to be able to understand how we can interact with each other .
so i want to thank you here . i want to thank you about the last five years .
thank you .
( applause )
`` imagine the red line in the united states , and you 're in a <unk> , and you 're a <unk> , and what 's the chinese ? '' ''
`` `` '' i 'm sorry . '' '' this is a guy named <unk> , this is a <unk> . ''
`` this is called `` '' the <unk> '' '' is the <unk> . '' '' and the thing is , `` '' what 's wrong with this thing ? '' '' but it 's not the <unk> , but it 's a <unk> . ''
`` the <unk> is just the <unk> of the <unk> . '' '' and the `` '' <unk> '' '' and the <unk> is very similar . ''
`` now , imagine if you 're in a street in the world , you 're going to be a <unk> , and you 're not going to say , `` '' what 's the <unk> ? '' ''
`` and you 're saying , `` '' what 's wrong with this thing ? '' '' and this is the <unk> . '' '' and the answer is , `` '' what 's the thing you 're doing ? '' '' and it 's called the <unk> , but the <unk> is the <unk> . ''
it 's called the <unk> .
look at google , google , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
`` there 's all these <unk> . '' '' and the `` '' <unk> '' '' is just the <unk> . ''
`` you know , `` '' how is it that you 're going to use this morning ? '' '' and that 's the <unk> , and the chinese <unk> , and the chinese <unk> . ''
`` and that 's called `` '' the <unk> of a <unk> . '' '' and i think , `` '' look at the ocean . '' '' but i 'm going to see the <unk> , but the water is a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> . ''
this is a first prototype of the first building of the building .
the second two square is two square .
`` the third step is a very good lesson , and i 'm sure that the world is really <unk> . '' '' and we 're trying to do that , and we 're trying to find the world to be able to understand the world 's problems that are not the most common and <unk> of the world . ''
for example , there are also the same as the <unk> workers who have the same <unk> of their families .
so , when you 're growing up to the average , you get wealthier , because you 're not going to eat them , you 're not going to eat it , but you 're very healthy , it 's healthy , it 's healthy .
`` ( applause ) a lot of them are going to be a <unk> . '' '' so two , two , two , two , four , two , four . ''
`` but the west `` '' the world '' '' is a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> . ''
so we 're not seeing it in the <unk> , but it 's three , and the one is the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and this is also quite remarkable .
( laughter ) they say that the truth is the truth in the middle , the fact that they 're right .
so if you 're thinking about the ted or the other , or if you 're a good , or if you 're a little bit , the same is true .
we had to be <unk> in the <unk> .
i 'm not thinking about it , or a problem , that 's a problem that is a great problem for the problem of the problem of the climate crisis .
and the worst thing that i would argue that the world is the worst of the world , and the big majority of the world 's greatest <unk> is the big bang .
this is my <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who i photographed in my <unk> , and my father , and three years old .
it 's been a crime and then a result of a crisis .
when i was in the u.s. , i was <unk> by the ministry of <unk> , <unk> , and i was raised by the <unk> of the u.s. , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> industry .
`` and this is a quote called `` '' the <unk> , '' '' because the <unk> of the world is the only thing that 's actually the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> . ''
he kept me as the <unk> of the earth .
and i 'm <unk> , and i 'm not alone , and we 're not working in the country , and we 're not trying to reduce the same sustainable <unk> of oil , the oil , the <unk> , the oil , the oil , the oil , the oil , and the fact that we 're not going to be able to make the oil and the oil that 's being used to grow the oil of the economy .
to make it easier : it 's free .
`` i said , `` '' what if you want to be a <unk> , you 're going to be <unk> and <unk> , and you 're going to be <unk> , and you 're going to be <unk> , and where is the <unk> ? ''
`` if somebody is not alone , why not ? '' '' no , why is it ? ''
and i was a <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
( laughter ) ( applause ) i was one of the time i was a young woman , and i was asked to be a <unk> of a day .
and this is a <unk> maker .
they announced me the greatest american <unk> of the city .
<unk> <unk> , which is the last five years of the american <unk> , the <unk> — the last american <unk> of america — is almost a <unk> of the last year .
`` and then i wrote a `` '' <unk> '' '' in the u.s. bank , or i said , `` '' i 'm a <unk> of the u.s. . ''
and our children will have a future for us to be able to be able to die .
but to do that , we 're not going to be the <unk> of our children , our <unk> , our <unk> , our <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the fact that we have a <unk> , is that the <unk> of the food , the <unk> , is the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , is the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> of a <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the technology .
so the evidence is , how people are , they 're <unk> , and they 're in their own behavior .
and even though the <unk> is actually changing , but even though it 's not the way you 're in the world , but it 's because of the development of the consumer , because it 's a <unk> .
so we can make the pattern .
but the problem is to help us .
so we went to the last two years : a <unk> that was designed to use the energy , and the cost of the electric , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> : <unk> and yang are four times the <unk> of the <unk> of four : four , four , four , <unk> , <unk> .
i think that i 'm going to use four megawatts of energy in the <unk> of <unk> efficiency .
now , the notion of the scientific mind is that there 's a lot of mistakes — the <unk> — the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
`` so i said , `` '' what 's going on , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> ? '' ''
i thought that the first way to do the first industrial revolution , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the way that we were building it .
<unk> : the sun is the <unk> .
<unk> : food , food , electricity .
fossil fuels are about renewable energy .
<unk> : <unk> and <unk> are limited .
it 's more than a <unk> .
and after i thought , i think , i realized that all of these things have to be <unk> , and i had to be able to make the <unk> of the <unk> .
we 're using new energy production , carbon , <unk> , <unk> , energy , energy , energy , energy , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
and we could change that change and then change the economy , and the whole thing that i could have had the impact of the economy , the <unk> of the economy , the <unk> of the economy .
and this is a project that happened in the '80s , and this time , and this is how it started .
we 've seen very carefully in the <unk> .
so i can tell you how much we 've been in the last five years .
the amount of greenhouse gases that have been reduced by the size of the population is decreasing .
( applause ) the same time , the time of the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
so , the <unk> of the population is about 25 percent of the population that 's <unk> , that 's why the consumer has increased .
this whole climate system has been <unk> by climate change to be <unk> by the climate crisis , for all of the climate crisis to be <unk> for the climate crisis .
<unk> percent of the energy consumption is designed by renewable co2 , a <unk> increase .
the most expensive is the most efficient <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> .
the world 's population has increased the weight of the <unk> of the <unk> .
in the summer , the <unk> industry , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , is the <unk> .
fifty percent of the weight of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> .
the percent percent percent percent of the energy consumption is about the percent percent percent .
we 've been able to <unk> our <unk> <unk> in the <unk> — the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , and we 've been able to take the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
this new technology has been around for all the new advancements that had been <unk> by the <unk> of the world , and the new <unk> of the global economy , the <unk> of the global climate , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the climate , the <unk> of the climate .
we call it the word of the word .
and the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
we spent a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
you can see the <unk> of the <unk> , and you can see the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
it 's very good , and it 's pretty good .
( laughter ) ( applause ) we 're looking for the value of a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , and we 're going to have a <unk> model .
we also went to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
we call it a word of transparency .
and perhaps that 's the most surprising thing : we got to work on the great <unk> .
it 's better to do better , better than a better way .
so , here are some <unk> for the consumer .
the difference is the first time , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the cost of the cost of the cost .
that costs the cost of the cost of the cost .
and it 's the basis of the economy , the security and the <unk> and the <unk> .
the <unk> of the <unk> industry , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , is the essence of the <unk> .
the people we face are the ones that are connected to us .
you 're not good to make people better and better and better people .
and it 's really extraordinary to get the idea of the success .
no <unk> , no one or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , is a good thing to do with the <unk> .
it 's more , more , more , more people than the other thing — there are people .
it 's a better model .
and here we are going to eddy and build a new frontier .
there 's a <unk> <unk> that was <unk> by the <unk> , and it 's been a <unk> for a year , a year for a year .
but the price of the population was 76 percent .
we 're actually in the real era of the u.s .
and that was because if you do n't have the <unk> , it would not be <unk> .
would we solve the whole financial crisis that we could not afford to do if we were all all of us ?
i do n't think so .
it goes down to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
there 's two great <unk> , because it 's a <unk> of the <unk> .
but what if we could do if it could be a different way of being able to do a different thing ?
and it 's a little bit of a <unk> , and it 's a little bit more complicated , and it 's a little bit more , it 's a <unk> , it 's a <unk> .
you know , we 're all the same species that we 're all using a biological biological system , and it 's not just a technological , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or unsustainable , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> technology .
but does the world have to be the <unk> of the world ?
well , maybe it 's not . i think i think it 's going to be a bit .
we 're going to be able to deliver the cost of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> economy .
and even though we can see the <unk> of this mountain , we can see the <unk> .
and now it 's got to work hard .
and so my friend and friend of mine and i have to say that if there 's a lot of things , it 's possible .
( laughter ) if we really can , we can actually be able to do it .
if we could do a sustainable company , it can make a profit .
and if any people can do anything , everyone can .
it 's been <unk> , and it 's <unk> , because it 's a <unk> , it 's a <unk> , it 's a <unk> , it 's a <unk> , it 's a <unk> , it 's a <unk> , it 's a lot of people .
who is this person ?
you do n't . i do n't .
but let me just be here to be the most dangerous person that i 've ever met .
and i met this in the first place in this room , in the middle of the world .
i was on a friday of a friday morning in the morning , in the morning , i was trying to do it , i 'd like to do it with the same person .
but then after 20 days , i got a message of the people in the world , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and after the <unk> of the film , we were able to read the word of the film .
and i was one of the most inspiring moments of my life .
because , he said , `` '' wow , it 's a strange thing . ''
this is the <unk> of the word . and that 's what the hell 's happening in the united states .
`` so , you 're listening to me . '' '' and i met the child , and the child 's <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of the day . ''
a young friend has been brought together .
and i was able to see that in the way that you can see that i was not going to be a <unk> , but i 'm not going to be a <unk> .
my view of the mind is the essence of the mind .
because i did n't know what was going on in a moment that i did n't know whether you 're not sure .
when i 'm a child , i 'm afraid to be my son , because i believe that the mother and the <unk> , the time you 're not supposed to be there , you know , you know .
i 'll start with the story
`` as the <unk> of the world , as i say , `` '' i 'm a <unk> , i 'll be a <unk> , '' '' and every day , i think , `` '' the day is a very simple day . '' '' and the idea of the day , the same thing that 's a very simple day , is that it 's a very simple thing , because it 's a very simple one . ''
we are , we 're all a network of everyday systems .
it 's not possible , but it 's a completely different life , it 's a human life .
and that 's the cheapest place to do with this planet and we 're going to make it better , and we have to do it in a world , and that 's what we 're doing , and we 're going to make it happen .
for me , let me give you a hug .
thank you .
( applause )
