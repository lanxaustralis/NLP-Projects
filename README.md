# NLP-Projects

## Project 1

  * Change the *dir* variable according to the test environment
  * Please run ***naive-bow.jl*** file
  * Play with constants as you would like to 

## Project 2

  * There are two main files which are totally ready to be tested
  * The only difference for both files is the array type which can be manipulated with respect to the test environment
  
  	* CPU version of the code is worked on a CPU machine, but would be a suffering choice to be tested
	
		> *GPU version is really fast, but has memory allocation issues which we searched a lot, but could not offer a perfectly working solution* **(SOLVED!)**
	
	* *Restricted the memory used by **KnetArray** which causes a memory shortage when the randomness needed*
		* Use the latest version of the limited test file for the final training test
		
			> Commenting in the previous test cases would be sufficient to test all project
