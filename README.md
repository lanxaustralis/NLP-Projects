# NLP-Projects
Will be added individual folders for each assignment, soon.

For the first assignment,
  -- First of all, please change the dir variable according to working environment
  -- Please run naive-bow.jl file
  -- Play with constants as you would like to 

For the second assignment,
  -- There are two main files which are totally ready to be tested
	-> CPU version of the code is worked on a CPU machine, but would be suffering choice to be tested
	-> GPU version is really fast, but has memory allocation issues which we searched a lot, but could not offer a perfectly working solution
  -- The only difference for both files are array type which is stored in variable, as well
	-> Changing it with respect to the environment is also a way to handle
  -- Good Luck
